## OnStepAdapter Migration — 2026-06-14

All mount and focuser hardware communication now flows exclusively through the external `onstep_adapter` package (tschoenfelder/OnStepAdapter). `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/` is an override layer — it subclasses the pip-installed package; it does NOT contain a hand-rolled copy. See `SYNC.md` for sync state, active SYNC-OVERRIDEs, and upgrade procedure.

### Completed (initial migration to pip-installed package)

- [x] Install `onstep_adapter` wheel and register in `SYNC.md` as external module
- [x] Sync 9 implementation files from OnStepAdapter GitHub into `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/`
- [x] Add `build_onstep_safety_config()` to `config.py` — bridges config.toml → `OnStepSafetyConfig`
- [x] Update `runtime.py` to use `OnStepClient` lifecycle with safety config
- [x] SYNC-OVERRIDE: add `move(direction, move_ms)` to `OnStepMount` delegating to `guide()` (REQ-1 interim)
- [x] Surface `safety_lock` as `safety_violation` in `MountStatus` API response
- [x] Handle `OnStepSafetyError` in `mount_operations.py` (imported with fallback) and return HTTP 409 from goto
- [x] `MountObservedState` extended with `safety_violation` field; poll loop populates from adapter

### Upgrade to v0.3.0 — 2026-06-17

Release: <https://github.com/tschoenfelder/OnStepAdapter/releases/tag/v0.3.0>

- [x] ONS3-001 Update `pyproject.toml` wheel URL to v0.3.0 `[P1 · Build]`
  - *Done:* `onstep-adapter @ .../v0.3.0/onstep_adapter-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl` already in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] ONS3-002 Install new wheel: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and confirm `onstep_adapter.__version__ == "0.3.0"` `[P1 · Build]`
  - *Done:* version confirmed 0.3.0; `onstep_adapter.__init__.py` is a re-export shim pointing to `smart_telescope.adapters.onstep.*`
- [x] ONS3-003 Review each REQ-ST-* override in `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/mount.py` — check if v0.3.0 base class now handles any of them and remove those that are no longer needed `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* All REQ-ST-001..007 overrides must stay — upstream v0.3.0 is a re-export shim with no independent implementation; overrides are permanent until upstream adds real implementations
- [x] ONS3-004 Review `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/client.py` — its `__init__` replicates the base `OnStepClient.__init__` body; update if upstream signature changed `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `client.py` is SmartTScope-owned complete implementation; no upstream signature change; no action needed
- [x] ONS3-005 Run full unit test suite: `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -x -q` — all tests pass `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 2942 passed, 24 skipped (2026-06-21); fixed 4 classes of pre-existing failures found during run: ArchiveConfig default, catalog/star-selector HA filtering not patched in tests, park tests missing `confirmed=True`, stretch test expected percentile behavior from sigma-stretch
- [x] ONS3-006 Commit: `git commit -m "chore: upgrade onstep_adapter to v0.3.0"` `[P1 · Build]`
  - *Done:* committed 2026-06-21

### Open Enhancement Requests (pending external delivery — tracked in SYNC.md)

- [ ] REQ-1: `move(direction, move_ms)` at slew rate in `OnStepMount` — interim delegates to `guide()`
- [ ] REQ-2: `get_park_position() → MountPosition | None` and `set_park_position() → bool` — **stays in SmartTScope shim** (v0.3.0 already has `set_park_position_from_current()` and `get_stored_park_position()`; these two wrappers adapt to `MountPort` signatures)
- [ ] REQ-3: Sticky AT_HOME state tracking in adapter (currently in `DeviceStateService`)
- [ ] REQ-4: Hardware watchdog property on `OnStepMount` (currently in `DeviceStateService`)
- [ ] REQ-5: Command audit trail properties on `OnStepMount` (currently in `DeviceStateService`)

### Replace SmartTScope adapter reimplementation with pip package

`smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/mount.py` is 4,408 lines. The goal is to delete it and reduce the adapter layer to a ≤30-line shim that satisfies `MountPort`/`FocuserPort` ABC compliance while delegating all logic to `onstep_adapter`.

**Architecture reality (discovered 2026-06-17):** `onstep_adapter` v0.3.0 is NOT an independent library. Its `__init__.py` consists entirely of `from smart_telescope.adapters.onstep.* import ...` — it re-exports SmartTScope's own code. The only files in the package are `__init__.py` and two smoke-test tools. There is no independent `_BaseMount`. All methods (REQ-1, REQ-ST-001..007) already "exist" in v0.3.0 only because they exist in SmartTScope's own adapter layer.

**What this means:** The migration is blocked on creating an **independent codebase** in the OnStepAdapter repo. The upstream work is not "add these methods" but "implement the full adapter independently so SmartTScope can import from it without circular dependency". REQ-1 and REQ-ST-001..007 describe the methods that independent implementation must include.

REQ-2 is NOT an upstream requirement — `set_park_position()` and `get_park_position()` stay permanently in the shim as `MountPort` interface adapters over the existing `set_park_position_from_current()` / `get_stored_park_position()` methods.

**End state:** `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/` contains only a thin `OnStepMount(_PipMount, MountPort): pass` shim. No LX200 commands, no serial bus logic, no method implementations remain in this repo.

#### Phase 0 — Upstream contributions (must happen first)

File the following as issues/PRs on `tschoenfelder/OnStepAdapter`:

| ID | Upstream ask | Reasoning |
|----|-------------|-----------|
| REQ-1 | `move(direction, move_ms) → bool` in `_BaseMount` | MountPort contract; generic center-rate timed move for any GEM user. |
| ~~REQ-2~~ | ~~`set_park_position() → bool`~~ | **NOT upstream** — v0.3.0 already has `set_park_position_from_current()` and `get_stored_park_position()`; SmartTScope's `set_park_position()` and `get_park_position()` are thin `MountPort`-compliance wrappers that stay in the shim. |
| REQ-ST-001 | `ensure_time_location_synced()` | Pre-observation clock+location sync is needed by every OnStep client. |
| REQ-ST-002 | `confirmed_by_user` param in `sync_onstep_time_location()` sets `time_trust_source="user_confirmed"` | Safety trust tracking — any safety-aware client needs this to clear clock locks. |
| REQ-ST-003 | `_explicit_tracking_started` flag in `get_state()` prevents ``:hR#`` auto-tracking from masking AT_HOME | Firmware quirk (auto-tracking after unpark) affects all GEM OnStep users. |
| REQ-ST-004 | `enable_tracking()` at-home bypass skips HA/altitude checks when HOME RA is stale | GEM HOME-position safety; stale RA produces false limit blocks at HOME. |
| REQ-ST-005 | `disable_tracking_verified()` clears `_explicit_tracking_started` | Correctness: without the clear, `get_state()` returns TRACKING forever after verified disable. |
| REQ-ST-006 | `stop()` / `park()` / `unpark()` each clear `_explicit_tracking_started` | Same flag lifecycle issue — all state-changing commands must reset the flag. |
| REQ-ST-007 | `motion_safety_preflight()` pier-side guards: (a) `terminal_state` check; (b) suppress stale `:Gm#` when `axis2 < 15°` at HOME | GEM safety refinement; stale pier-side blocks valid GoTo at CWD home position. |

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-001 File upstream issue: REQ-1 `move(direction, move_ms) → bool` `[P1 · External]`
- [x] ONS-MIGRATE-002 ~~File upstream: REQ-2~~ — v0.3.0 already has `set_park_position_from_current()` + `get_stored_park_position()`; shim methods stay in SmartTScope (MountPort ABC compliance only) `[P1 · External]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-003 File upstream issues: REQ-ST-001..007 (flag lifecycle, pier-side guards, at-home bypass, confirmed_by_user sync) `[P1 · External]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-004 Confirm upstream release incorporating the above; update `pyproject.toml` wheel URL `[P1 · Build]`

#### Phase 1 — Audit (after upstream release)

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-005 Install new wheel; verify each REQ-ST-* is now in the base class; mark covered overrides for deletion `[P1 · Runtime]`

#### Phase 2 — Reduce adapter layer

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-006 Replace `mount.py` (4,408 lines) with shim: `class OnStepMount(_PipMount, MountPort): pass` plus any REQ-* override bodies not yet in upstream `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-007 Reduce or delete `client.py`; if upstream `OnStepClient` injects its own mount, remove shim class entirely `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-008 Delete 6 thin re-export files (`results.py`, `safety.py`, `serial_bus.py`, `state_store.py`, `firmware_proof.py`, `focuser.py`); update `__init__.py` to re-export from `onstep_adapter.*` `[P2 · Runtime]`
- [x] ONS-MIGRATE-009 Update import sites: `runtime.py`, `config.py`, `api/mount.py`, `services/mount_operations.py` — all now import from `adapters.onstep` package `__init__.py`, not internal submodules. Dead `OnStepSafetyError` import removed from `mount_operations.py`. Defensive `try/except ImportError` removed from `api/mount.py` and `mount_operations.py`. Ready for final rename to `from onstep_adapter import ...` once upstream is independent. `[P1 · Runtime]`

#### Phase 2b — Consumer API migration (no direct serial communication in api/ or services/)

- [x] ONS-MIGRATE-009b `FocuserPort` extended with `status() → FocuserStatus` and `move_absolute() → FocuserMoveResult`; `FocuserStatus`/`FocuserMoveResult` dataclasses defined in `ports/focuser.py` (canonical); `results.py` re-exports. `api/focuser.py` uses `focuser.status()` + `focuser.move_absolute()` — no individual property calls, no direct serial access. `MockFocuser`, `SimulatorFocuser` updated. 2942 tests pass. `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-009c (optional) Extend `MountPort` similarly with structured status call once mount-side richer API is defined upstream. `[P3 · Runtime]`

#### Phase 3 — Verify and close (after upstream independent implementation)

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-010 Run full unit test suite: `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -x -q` — all pass `[P1 · Tests]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-011 Verify: `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/mount.py` ≤ 30 lines; no `serial_bus` implementations remain in the adapter layer `[P1 · Process]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-012 Hardware smoke-test on Pi: connect → GoTo → STOP → park/unpark — all succeed with no regression `[P1 · Hardware]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-013 Commit and update `SYNC.md` to reflect shim-only state `[P1 · Build]`

## M1 — Hardware Safety Spine

*System controls moving parts predictably and can stop safely.*

### P0 Safety — Fix immediately

- [x] BUG-023 Shutdown with CTRL-C does not close OnStep connection; focuser keeps moving in small steps after exit `[P0 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* shutdown sequence stops motion and closes serial before process exits; verified on real Pi
  - *Done:* `RuntimeContext.shutdown()` calls `focuser.stop()` then `mount.stop()` then `mount.disconnect()` in lifespan teardown
- [x] BUG-005 Any component crash must not release control of mount or focuser; STOP must always respond `[P0 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Acceptance:* preview/camera failure does not affect mount/focuser control; STOP always completes within agreed time
  - *Done:* `_session_thread()` wraps `runner.run()` in a `finally` that calls `rt.job_manager.release()`; STOP endpoint calls `mount.stop()` directly (no coordinator); 10 explicit isolation tests in `tests/unit/api/test_bug005_isolation.py` — coordinator lock bypass, resource release on crash, STOP/goto available post-crash

### R1 — Hardware Command Coordinator

- [x] R1-001 Define `HardwareCommandCoordinator` `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-002 Define command types: stop, goto, park, unpark, home, guide, focuser move, focuser nudge `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-003 Define command priority rules `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-004 Make STOP priority higher than all normal commands `[P0 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* STOP endpoints call mount/focuser directly, never through coordinator
- [x] R1-005 Define command lifecycle states `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done (R2-003+R2-005):* Lifecycle is: command issued (record_command) → hardware executing (convergence helpers poll cached state) → done or error (record_command_error + observed state change); exposed in MountStatus.last_command/last_command_error
- [x] R1-006 Add command IDs and structured command logs `[P2 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-007 Move mount/focuser endpoint-local locks into coordinator `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `_goto_lock` removed from `mount.py`, `_move_lock` removed from `focuser.py`; all commands use `coordinator.mount_command()` / `coordinator.focuser_command()`
- [x] R1-008 Introduce OnStep serial bus abstraction `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-009 Stop exposing private mount serial methods to focuser adapter `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-010 Add concurrency, timeout, and STOP-priority tests `[P1 · Tests]`

- [ ] R1-011 Hardware verification: STOP during mount slew and STOP during focuser move `[P0 · Hardware]`
  - *Must have hardware evidence — not accepted on mock alone*

### R2 — Device State Service

- [x] R2-001 Define `DeviceStateService` `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R2-002 Define observed mount, focuser, and camera state models `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `MountObservedState` dataclass with state, ra, dec, polled_at, error
- [x] R2-003 Track last command, last observed state timestamp, and last error per device `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `DeviceStateService.record_command(name)`, `record_command_error(msg)`, `get_last_command()` added; all mount command endpoints (park, unpark, goto, home, track, stop) call `record_command` before issuing; errors recorded on failure; `MountStatus` response includes `last_command`, `last_command_age_s`, `last_command_error`; 4 new tests in `test_device_state.py`
- [x] R2-004 Poll mount and focuser state at controlled interval `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* background daemon thread polls every 2 s via `DeviceStateService`
- [x] R2-005 Add state convergence helpers for park, unpark, home, and goto completion `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `wait_for_mount_state(target, timeout_s)` waits until cached state equals target; `wait_while_mount_state(current, timeout_s)` waits until cached state differs; `mount_unpark` uses `wait_while_mount_state(PARKED)` to replace direct poll loop; `mount_park` uses `wait_for_mount_state(PARKED)` to confirm within 5 s; 6 new tests in `test_device_state.py`
- [x] R2-006 Add stale-state and slow-response detection `[P2 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `MountObservedState.is_stale()` uses 10 s threshold; `stale` field in `MountStatus`
- [x] R2-007 Change status endpoints and UI labels to use observed state `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `GET /api/mount/status` reads from `DeviceStateService` cache; falls back to direct poll only when cache is empty
- [x] R2-008 Test: command accepted but observed state unchanged `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 13 tests in `tests/unit/services/test_device_state.py` — poll lifecycle, stale detection, error propagation, position-skip on UNKNOWN, thread-safety

### Field bugs — Mount state

- [x] BUG-011 Park command moves mount but UNPARKED flag remains too long `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* UI label changes only after observed state confirms park; correct within 5 s
  - *Done:* `device_state.poll_now()` after park command refreshes cache immediately; frontend park poll loop extended from 10×500ms to 60×1000ms (60 s total — covers full park slew duration)
- [x] BUG-012 After reconnect, mount shown as unparked when policy requires parked `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `RuntimeContext.connect_devices()` calls `device_state.poll_now()` immediately after `start()` — cache populated from first millisecond of startup, no 2 s gap
- [x] BUG-016 Unpark returns HTTP 200 but label stays PARKED `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* label follows observed hardware state, not command receipt
  - *Done:* `device_state.poll_now()` after unpark command; timeout extended from 3 s to 5 s; frontend unpark loop extended to 20×500ms (10 s)

### Milestone M1 tasks

- [x] M1-001 Complete R1 hardware command coordinator `[P0 · Runtime]`

- [ ] M1-006 Verify STOP during focuser move (hardware evidence) `[P0 · Hardware]`
- [ ] M1-007 Verify shutdown during active motion (hardware evidence) `[P0 · Hardware]`

**Quality gate:** STOP works during mount slew and focuser movement. Shutdown leaves hardware controlled. Park/unpark UI follows observed state.

- [x] R0-006 Move autogain job reference into `RuntimeContext` or `JobManager` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `autogain_lock`, `_autogain_job` in RuntimeContext; `autogain.py` uses `_get_job()` / `_set_job()` wrappers; `reset_for_tests()` clears both
- [x] R0-007 Add explicit `shutdown()`, `connect_devices()`, `disconnect_devices()`, `reset_for_tests()` methods `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R0-008 Update API dependencies to read from app runtime `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R0-009 Keep compatibility wrappers during migration `[P2 · Runtime]`
- [x] R0-010 Add lifecycle tests `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 40 tests in `tests/unit/test_runtime.py` — init state, connect_devices (mock + simulator + idempotency + polling starts), shutdown (focuser stop, mount stop-before-disconnect, preview cameras, error tolerance), reset_for_tests (all cleared, session/autogain cleared, new adapters on next access), module singleton (get/set_runtime), session state management, autogain state management, FastAPI lifespan smoke tests
- [x] R0-011 Change `VerticalSliceRunner.run()` to not disconnect adapters in `finally`; release job ownership only; keep hardware live after session `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* removed `mount.disconnect()`, `camera.disconnect()`, `focuser.disconnect()` from `runner.py finally`; runtime shutdown sequence owns all device teardown; `test_run_does_not_disconnect_focuser_on_completion` verifies new contract

### R3 — Shared Job Manager

- [x] R3-001 Define `JobManager`, `Job`, `JobStatus`, `ResourceConflictError` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `smart_telescope/services/job_manager.py` — two modes: `submit()` (fully managed thread) and `claim()`/`release()` (caller-managed); timeout via companion daemon thread
- [x] R3-002 Define resource ownership model for camera, mount, focuser `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* convention: `"camera:N"`, `"mount"`, `"focuser"`; conflict check is atomic in `_register()`
- [x] R3-003 Add job status and cancellation APIs `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `cancel()`, `cancel_by_name()`, `cancel_all()`, `get_job()`, `get_by_name()`, `list_active()`, `active_resources()`, `is_resource_held()`, `purge_finished()`
- [x] R3-004 Migrate autogain to job manager `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `autogain.py` uses `rt.job_manager.submit("autogain", {"camera:N"}, _worker, ..., cancel_event=job.cancel, timeout_s=300)`; `ResourceConflictError` → 409
- [x] R3-005 Prevent session/autogain from competing for same camera/mount/focuser `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `session.py` uses `rt.job_manager.claim("session", {"camera:0", "mount", "focuser"})`; thread wrapper calls `release()` in finally; `ResourceConflictError` → 409
- [x] R3-006 Add cancellation checkpoints and timeouts `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* timeout watcher in `_start_timeout_watcher()`; autogain timeout 300 s; `cancel_event` bridge between `_Job.cancel` and JobManager
- [x] R3-007 Tests: cancellation, resource conflict, failure isolation `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 40 tests in `tests/unit/services/test_job_manager.py` — submit/claim/release lifecycle, resource conflicts, cancellation (by id/name/all), timeout, query API, purge

### Field bugs — Jobs and concurrency

- [x] BUG-001 Autogain cancel does not stop for a long time `[P1 · Runtime · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Acceptance:* cancel completes within < 1 s of the cancel request (POD-002 decision)
  - *Done:* `CaptureAbortedError` + `abort_capture()` in `CameraPort`; ToupcamCamera polls `_frame_ready` every 50ms and breaks on `_abort` event; AutoGainService spawns an abort-watcher thread that calls `camera.abort_capture()` as soon as `cancellation_flag` is set; catches `CaptureAbortedError` → CANCELLED. Cancel latency ≤ 50ms. Two regression tests in `test_autogain_service.py::TestCancelLatency`.
- [x] BUG-002b Preview shows `AUTO_GAIN_POSSIBLE_FOCUS_OR_POINTING_ERROR` after autogain cancel `[P2 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
- [x] BUG-019 Focuser nudge returns 409 conflict and blocks far too long; rapid +20 presses mostly rejected `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* conflict cleared within 2 s; sequential presses each produce movement
  - *Done:* `_safe_move` moved `time.sleep(0.3)` and `started` check outside the coordinator lock; lock now covers only serial command (~50-100 ms), not the started-check sleep
- [x] BUG-022 Changing camera in Goto/Solve then pressing Find Best fails; WebSocket data transfer error logged `[P1 · Runtime · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* Added `mountGotoAndCenter()` JS function (was called but never defined); `onPreviewCamChange()` now stops/restarts preview WS on camera change

### Milestone M2 tasks

- [x] M2-001 Complete R0 runtime context `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] M2-002 Complete R3 shared job manager `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] M2-003 Define camera-use policy `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* convention `"camera:N"` / `"mount"` / `"focuser"` in JobManager; session claims `camera:0 + mount + focuser`; autogain claims `camera:{index}`; preview uses camera adapter's `_capture_lock` (serializes at hardware level); full role-based policy deferred to R4
- [x] M2-004 Prevent preview/autogain/session conflicts `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* session/autogain conflicts explicit via R3 `ResourceConflictError` → HTTP 409; preview serializes through adapter-level `_capture_lock`; concurrent preview + autogain on same camera serializes safely
- [x] M2-005 Add timeout policy for long-running jobs `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* autogain: 300 s timeout via JobManager companion watcher; session: user-initiated stop only (legitimate sessions run hours — hard timeout not appropriate)
- [x] M2-006 Ensure unrelated subsystems continue when one job fails `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* JobManager releases resources on DONE/FAILED/CANCELLED; `ResourceConflictError` is synchronous (caller gets 409, other subsystems unaffected)

**Quality gate:** Autogain cancel and session stop complete within agreed timeout. Camera conflicts are explicit. API exposes current job state and last error.

## M3 — Smart Setup and Optical Train Truth

*System knows the actual telescope setup and can tell the user whether it is ready.*

### R4 — Optical Train Registry

- [x] R4-001 Define `OpticalTrain` and `OpticalTrainRegistry` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `OpticalTrain` frozen dataclass + `OpticalTrainRegistry` with `from_config()`, `get()`, `main()`, `guide()`, `all()`, `by_camera_index()`, `by_camera_role()` — `smart_telescope/services/optical_train_registry.py`
- [x] R4-002 Include camera role, serial/logical name, focuser binding, cooling capability, pixel scale, solver profile `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `OpticalTrain` has `camera_role`, `camera_index`, `telescope_name`, `focal_mm`, `reducer_factor`, `pixel_scale_arcsec`, `has_focuser`, `focuser`; pixel scale priority: explicit TOML → derived from camera profile pixel_um → global fallback
- [x] R4-003 Load train definitions from config `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `OpticalTrainSpec` in config.py with `_parse_telescopes()` + `_parse_optical_trains()`; `[telescopes]` and `[optical_trains]` sections added to `templates/config.toml`
- [x] R4-004 Validate train definitions at startup `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `from_config()` collects all errors and raises `ValueError` listing every broken telescope/camera reference; `RuntimeContext.get_optical_train_registry()` catches errors and returns empty registry
- [x] R4-005 Replace product-facing camera index selection with train/role selection `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* All camera `<select>` elements now show train names ("main — c8", "guide — guide_scope"); values are train name strings; `_loadSelectFromTrains()` replaces `_loadSelectFromCameras()` for all camera selects; focuser autofocus select filters to trains with `has_focuser=true`
- [x] R4-006 Update preview, focuser, cooling, polar alignment, autogain, and setup to use train model `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* Preview WS accepts `camera_role` query param → resolves to index via registry; autogain `RunRequest` accepts `camera_role`; autofocus `AutofocusRequest` accepts `camera_role`; UI API calls pass `camera_role` (preview, autogain, autofocus); APIs that still need index (goto_and_center, solver, histogram, calibration, polar) resolve via `_trainCamIdx(role)` helper
- [x] R4-007 Tests for two-camera and three-camera/OAG setups `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 16 new tests in `tests/unit/api/test_r4_role_camera.py` — autogain role resolution (2-cam, 3-cam, unknown role fallback, backward compat), autofocus role resolution, preview WS role resolution, registry multi-train queries; 28 registry tests in `test_optical_train_registry.py`
- [x] R4-008 Make guided session optical-train aware: use role/train, never hard-code `camera:0`; derive `{"camera:N"}` from selected train `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `session_run` injects `OpticalTrainRegistry` via `Depends`; resolves `camera_resource = f"camera:{main_train.camera_index}"` from `registry.main()`; falls back to `"camera:0"` when no main train; 3 new tests in `test_r4_role_camera.py::TestSessionOpticalTrainAware`

### R5 — Config and Readiness Services

- [x] R5-001 Define `ConfigService` `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `ConfigError` exception class + `check_load_error()` function form the config service boundary; `_load_config_from_disk()` encapsulates all file loading logic
- [x] R5-002 Replace import-time config loading with explicit load `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* TOML loading moved into `_load_config_from_disk()` function; module globals still populated at import time for backward compat; `check_load_error()` is the explicit check point called by `RuntimeContext.connect_devices()`
- [x] R5-003 Replace config `sys.exit` with structured startup error `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `sys.exit(...)` replaced by `_load_error = ConfigError(...)` stored on parse failure; `check_load_error()` raises it at startup (`RuntimeContext.connect_devices`); `ReadinessService._check_config_file()` surfaces it as a RED item; 4 new tests in `test_readiness.py`
- [x] R5-004 Add resolved path model (expand `~/`) — already in config.py `_expand()` `[P1 · Config]`
- [x] R5-005 Validate stars.cfg, horizon file, storage, ASTAP executable, ASTAP catalog, camera roles — in `ReadinessService` `[P1 · Config]`
- [x] R5-006 Define `ReadinessService` → `smart_telescope/services/readiness.py` `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R5-007 Add red/yellow/green readiness summary → `/api/readiness` endpoint `[P1 · UI]`
- [x] R5-008 Add actionable repair guidance per failed check — `repair` field on every non-green item `[P1 · UI]`
- [x] R5-009 Update setup check endpoint and UI — readiness card at top of Stage 1, auto-loads on page open `[P1 · UI]`
- [x] R5-010 Tests: missing-file and invalid-config scenarios — `tests/unit/api/test_readiness.py` (22 tests) `[P1 · Tests]`
- [x] R5-011 Add explicit hardware mode field to readiness API and UI (`real` / `simulator` / `mock`) `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R5-012 Show OnStep time/location sync status in System Readiness card `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Acceptance:* readiness card includes a Mount (OnStep) row showing whether the OnStep clock and site coordinates are aligned with the Pi system time and configured observer lat/lon; green = synced within threshold, yellow = stale or unread, red = `onstep_clock_invalid` or `onstep_location_mismatch`; repair hint points user to the time/location sync action
  - *Done:* `MountPort.get_sync_status()` added (no-op default); `OnStepMount.get_sync_status()` calls `read_onstep_clock()` (`:GC#`/`:GL#`) + `read_onstep_site()` (`:Gt#`/`:Gg#`) and returns summary dict; `ReadinessService._check_time_location_sync()` maps result to `time_location_sync` ReadinessItem (GREEN/YELLOW/RED); skipped when mount not connected; 8 new tests in `TestTimeLLocationSyncCheck`
  - *Acceptance:* `/api/readiness` includes `mode` field; `can_observe=true` blocked when mode is `mock` or `simulator`; UI label shows "REAL", "SIMULATOR", or "MOCK"; prevents accidental real-sky session with mock devices
  - *Done:* `RuntimeContext._hardware_mode` set by `_build_adapters()` from adapter types (ToupcamCamera+OnStepMount→real, Simulator→simulator, Mock→mock); `hardware_mode` property exposed; `ReadinessReport.mode` field added; `can_observe` blocked for non-real modes; mode item in readiness items list; REAL/SIMULATOR/MOCK badge in UI header; 8 new tests in `test_readiness.py`

### Field bugs — Config and optical train

- [x] BUG-008 `stars.cfg` not found on Pi even though file exists — tilde path not expanded `[P1 · Config · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done (R5-004):* `_expand()` using `Path.expanduser()` was added for all path globals (`STARS_CFG`, `HORIZON_DAT`, `STORAGE_DIR`, `IMAGE_ROOT`, `APP_STATE_DIR`); `STARS_CFG` default also constructed via `Path.home()` so tilde is never stored literally; verified by 4 new `TestExpandPath` tests in `test_readiness.py`
- [x] BUG-009 Cooling controls offered in setup page for cameras that don't support cooling `[P2 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `onCoolingCamChange(role)` added — fetches `/api/cameras/{idx}/capabilities` for the selected train's camera and shows/hides the cooling card based on `has_tec`; called on select `onchange`, on "Connect All", and at page init; replaces the old "any camera has TEC" heuristic
- [x] BUG-010 Focuser log says not available, then later says available — connect ordering issue `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* focuser `is_available` reflects true hardware state after `connect()` even when serial buffer has stale bytes from mount init
  - *Done:* `OnStepFocuser.connect()` retries `:FA#` up to 3× with 300 ms gap; breaks on first `"1"`; logs each attempt; only warns when all attempts fail. Handles stale bytes left by `:GVP#` or `disable_tracking()` during `mount.connect()`. 4 new tests in `test_onstep_focuser.py::TestConnectRetry` — first-attempt success (no retry), 0→1 retry, exhausted (3×"0"), empty→"1".
- [x] BUG-013 Setup check fails to move mount at all `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Root cause:* `OnStepMount.connect()` made only a single stale-ACK retry; a second stale byte from a previous session's `disable_tracking()` exhausted the retry and closed the serial port. With `_serial = None`, all subsequent `get_state()` calls returned `UNKNOWN`, and the setup check wizard silently skipped all mount movement tests.
  - *Done:* `OnStepMount.connect()` retries `:GVP#` up to 3× with 300 ms gap + input buffer flush each time; only fails after all attempts exhausted; accepts any response containing "on"+"step" (case-insensitive); also accepts `'On-Step#On-Step'` doubled responses seen in the field. Setup check JS message changed from silent "state unknown — skipped" to "mount not connected — use Connect All to reconnect". 5 new tests in `test_onstep_mount.py::TestConnectRetry`.
- [x] BUG-017 Focuser linked to guide cam on status page; config requires it linked to main camera 678M `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done (R4-005):* Focuser cam select now populated via `_loadSelectFromTrains()` filtered to `has_focuser=true`; guide cam train has `has_focuser=false` so it never appears in focuser controls
- [x] BUG-003 Startup shows both cameras under focuser section but not under cooling, polar alignment, or preview `[P1 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Done (R4-005):* All camera selects now use train-based population; focuser select filters to `has_focuser=true`; cooling, PA, preview each populate independently from train registry
- [x] BUG-024 Preview shows `AUTO_GAIN_POSSIBLE_FOCUS_OR_POINTING_ERROR` for camera with no focuser connected `[P2 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `_worker()` in `autogain.py` now resolves the train's `has_focuser` via `registry.by_camera_index(camera_index)` and ANDs it with `focuser.is_available`; guide camera with no focuser configured returns NO_SIGNAL instead of POSSIBLE_FOCUS_OR_POINTING_ERROR even when main camera's focuser is available; 4 new tests in `test_r4_role_camera.py`

### Milestone M3 tasks

- [x] M3-001 Complete R4 optical train registry `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* R4-001..007 all complete
- [x] M3-002 Complete R5 config/readiness services `[P1 · Config]`

  - *Done:* BUG-009 (cooling card per TEC capability) and BUG-024 (autogain FOCUS_ERROR for no-focuser cameras) both resolved
- [x] M3-005 Provide red/yellow/green setup readiness `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* R5-007 completed this

**Quality gate:** Main camera/focuser association correct. Guide camera not shown as focus-controlled. Cooling absent for non-cooled cameras. Setup check detects missing files and devices.

  - *Done (R4-005):* All camera selects show train names ("main — c8", "guide — guide_scope")
- [x] UX3-002 Show guide/OAG/wide-field camera only as configured roles `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (R4-005):* Trains appear only when configured; focuser select filters to has_focuser=true
- [x] UX3-003 Show serial/logical name only in diagnostics `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Camera IDs / hardware serials shown only in `cameraCard()` in Stage 6 scan area. Main UI uses optical train role names ("main", "guide") throughout.

  - *Done (BUG-009/M3-004):* Cooling card shown/hidden dynamically via `onCoolingCamChange()` based on camera TEC capability; focuser controls filtered by `has_focuser` in optical train registry.

### UX4 — Advanced Mode For Manual Controls

- [x] UX4-001 Add beginner/advanced mode distinction `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* "Advanced" toggle button in header; state persisted in `localStorage` (`tsc_advanced_mode`). `body.advanced-mode` CSS class controls `.adv-only` visibility.
- [x] UX4-002 Move manual mount controls to advanced/diagnostics (except emergency stop) `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Home / Unpark / Park / Enable Tracking / Disable Tracking wrapped in `.adv-only` span in `mountCard()`. Stop always visible.
- [x] UX4-003 Move manual focuser controls to advanced/diagnostics (except recovery actions) `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Nudge buttons (±1000/±100/±10) and Move To row wrapped in `.adv-only` in `focuserCard()`. Autofocus and Stop always visible.
- [x] UX4-004 Keep emergency stop globally visible at all times `[P0 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Mount strip now starts visible (class `visible` in HTML); `goToStage()` no longer hides it on Stage 1. STOP button is in the strip at all times.

### UX5 — Recovery-Oriented Errors

- [x] UX5-001 Define error model: what happened / safety state / user action / retry `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `friendlyError(raw)` maps raw error strings to `{message, hint}`. `setStatus(..., true)` renders the translated message + hint. Recovery banner (UX2-004) covers session failures.
- [x] UX5-002 Map OnStep command errors to user-facing messages `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `_ERROR_PATTERNS` includes serial timeout, serial error, rejected command, not connected, not aligned, unsafe position patterns.
- [x] UX5-003 Map camera errors to user-facing messages `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Camera not found, capture timeout, camera error patterns in `_ERROR_PATTERNS`.
- [x] UX5-004 Map solver errors to user-facing messages `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* ASTAP not found, catalog not found, no stars, plate solve failed patterns in `_ERROR_PATTERNS`.
- [x] UX5-005 Add diagnostics link for advanced error details `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `setStatus(..., true)` now appends a "→ Setup & Diagnostics" link that calls `goToStage(1)`. Visible on every error status banner.

### Field bugs — UX and errors

- [x] BUG-014 Home button generates HTTP 500; message `Home failed: GoTo failed` gives no cause or next action `[P1 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `mount_home` now returns `"Home slew failed — check mount is tracking and powered (<detail>)"`
  - *Acceptance:* error states cause, current safety state, and recommended next action
- [x] BUG-015 HOME, PARK, UNPARK, STOP buttons should be grouped together `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
- [x] BUG-002 AG checkbox vs Autogain button layout confusing; AF button below histogram, autogain at bottom `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Done:* Split the single dense controls row into two rows: Row 1 = camera settings + display toggles (Str/Hist) + Solve + AF + status spans; Row 2 = "Auto-gain:" label + "Adjust live" checkbox (with clarified tooltip) + `│` separator + "Find Best" button + Cancel + status badge. No JS changes — all element IDs preserved.
- [x] BUG-004 Histogram should show detail below ADU 1000 and current block size above `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Done:* `showHistogram()` now draws `0–Xk ADU · N ADU/bin` as a text overlay inside the canvas top-right; `s3-hist-low-label` given an id and updated dynamically by `_updateLowLabel()` on each draw (was hardcoded "5 ADU/bin", now shows real bin size)
- [x] BUG-021 Histogram not filled at small values `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `histogram_bins_focused` no longer uses `adc_max×0.05` floor — dim images (p99.9=200 ADU) now zoom to 1000 ADU range instead of 3276, filling the canvas 3× better; JS bar rendering uses `Math.max(1, Math.round(hRaw))` for non-zero bins so every bin with any pixels shows at least 1px

### Milestone M4 tasks

- [x] M4-001 Implement `Ready to Observe` first-run screen `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX1):* Readiness card loads automatically on Stage 1 page open; red/yellow/green summary with repair guidance.
- [x] M4-002 Implement target recommendation view `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* "Visible Tonight" card in Stage 5 uses `/api/catalog/tonight` to list Messier objects above 20° sorted by altitude; clicking any row sets the target; card auto-loads on entering Stage 5.
- [x] M4-003 Implement `Start Observation` guided workflow `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX2):* Pipeline step strip shows Connect→GoTo→Centre→Focus→Capture live; recovery banner on failure.
- [x] M4-004 Move manual controls into advanced/diagnostics mode `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX4-001/002/003):* Advanced Mode toggle in header; Home/Unpark/Park/Tracking hidden in beginner mode; focuser nudge/Move-To hidden in beginner mode.
- [x] M4-005 Add recovery-oriented errors `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX5):* `friendlyError()` + `_ERROR_PATTERNS` in setStatus; recovery banner in session.
- [x] M4-006 Keep emergency stop globally visible `[P0 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX4-004):* Mount strip always visible on all stages.

**Quality gate:** User can start observing without manually managing solve/focus/gain/recenter. Beginner mode avoids camera indices and hardware jargon. Recovery messages tell user what to do next.

## Guiding Pipeline

*Source: `resources/hlrequirements/onstep_guiding_requirements.md`*

Guide camera processing subsystem: acquire frames through camera adapter, measure guide-star centroid, convert pixel error to pulse-guide corrections via OnStep adapter. Runs as a non-blocking worker; does not block the main imaging workflow.

**Architecture note:** The guiding subsystem is a client of the existing camera and mount adapters — it does not open hardware directly. `domain/guiding.py` domain models are already in place (from camera_adapter integration). The test file `tests/unit/services/test_guide_measurement.py` activates when GUD-002 is implemented.

- [x] GUD-001 Add `guide(direction, duration_ms)` to `MountPort`; implement in `OnStepMount` and `MockMount` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `guide()` already exists on `MountPort` (line 56), `OnStepMount` (line 219), and `MockMount` (line 69) — camera_adapter's OnStep mount was already synced with guide support
- [x] GUD-002 Implement `smart_telescope/services/guide_measurement.py` — `CentroidConfig`, `GuideCentroidEstimator`, `GuideSourceSelector`, `MeasureOnlyGuideController`, `source_state_from_measurement` `[P1 · Service]`
  - *Done:* MAD-based noise estimator; windowed centroid; `GuideSourceSelector` falls back on TRANSIENT_BAD or HARD_FAILED; `MeasureOnlyGuideController` with deadband, aggressiveness, pulse clamping; 6 tests all pass
- [x] GUD-003 Implement `GuideWorker` service — bounded frame queue from camera adapter, per-cycle centroid, `GuideSourceState` output `[P1 · Service]`
  - *Done (merged into GUD-004):* `FrameMailbox` (latest-frame drop semantics) in `managed_camera.py`; `ManagedCamera` background thread per role; `GuidingService._loop()` never blocks main event loop; drops stale frames via mailbox
- [x] GUD-004 Implement `GuideController` — pixel error to pulse-guide corrections with deadband and pulse clamping `[P1 · Service]`
  - *Done:* `MeasureOnlyGuideController` in `guide_measurement.py`; `GuidingService` in `guiding_service.py`; sub-deadband frames produce no pulse; `measure_only=true` default; real mount pulses sent when `measure_only=false`; `_lifecycle_lock` on start+stop; `started_at` passed as thread param
- [x] GUD-005 Wire guiding config into `config.py`: `GUIDING: GuidingSpec` already parsed; guide camera via `get_camera_by_role("guide")` in runtime `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `GUIDING: GuidingSpec` already parsed in `config.py`; `get_camera_by_role("guide")` already in `runtime.py` from camera_adapter integration
- [x] GUD-006 API: `POST /api/guiding/start`, `POST /api/guiding/stop`, `GET /api/guiding/status` `[P1 · API]`
  - *Done:* `api/guiding.py` — start returns 202 + `{state, roles}` (no job_id; guiding is a long-running service, not a one-shot job); stop returns final status; status returns full `GuidingStatus.to_dict()`; 409 if already running, 422 if no cameras; deps wired in `deps.py` + `runtime.py`
- [x] GUD-007 Frontend guide monitoring card: lock state badge, correction arrow indicator, SNR readout `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `static/js/guiding.js` + Guide Monitor card in `index.html` (advanced mode only); state badge (IDLE/RUNNING/FAILED); source health badges with centroid coords and confidence; pulse summary; polls `/api/guiding/status` every 2 s when running
- [ ] GUD-008 Verify guiding on real hardware: guide camera locks onto star, corrections visible in OnStep `[P1 · Hardware]`

## Deferred — Post-Release 1.0

- [ ] PARK-SET-001 Add "Set Park Position" button to the mount tile `[P3 · UX · Post-1.0]`
  - *Context:* Park currently slews to the position saved in OnStep EEPROM (set once during initial setup via `:hS#`). There is no UI button to overwrite it.
  - *Scope:* Add a "Set Park" button that calls `POST /api/mount/set_park` (`:hS#`). Show a confirmation dialog on that button only ("Save current position as park? This overwrites the stored park position."). The Park button itself should remain confirmation-free.

## Deferred — Post-MVP

- [ ] ONSTEP-REPLACE-001 Replace OnStep adapter with layered direct-USB implementation + safety state machine (9 states: DISCONNECTED → READY_UNATTENDED) `[P1 · Hardware · Future]`
  - *Source:* `resources/hlrequirements/smarttscope_onstep_adapter_replacement_requirements.md`
  - *Scope:* SerialTransport, OnStepProtocolClient, OnStepStatusParser, OnStepSafetyReader, OnStepRecoveryController; HOME/PARK confirmation; direction test; limit readback; LIMIT_HIT recovery workflow; startup safety UI checklist
  - *Blocked by:* external party delivery + answers to open questions Q1–Q10 in the requirements doc (baud rate, stable device path, HOME command behavior, limit readback support)
- [ ] WATCHDOG-001 Enable Pi hardware watchdog and systemd service watchdog for SmartTScope `[P2 · Infrastructure · Future]`
  - *Source:* `resources/hlrequirements/raspberry_pi5_trixie_watchdog_setup.md`

  - *Blocked by:* decision to migrate from `start.sh` to systemd
- [ ] WATCHDOG-002 Add external heartbeat supervisor for hardware STOP on Pi crash `[P2 · Infrastructure · Future]`
  - *Source:* `resources/hlrequirements/external_heartbeat_stop_supervisor.md`
  - *Scope:* Pi heartbeat sender sends `HB <n>` every 1 s; external microcontroller (Pico/Arduino/ESP32) times out after 3–5 s and triggers hardware STOP output; test with Pi power loss and process kill
  - *Blocked by:* external hardware available; WATCHDOG-001 done first
- [ ] BUG-007 Support frame types: bias, dark, flat frames; master frames; bad pixel maps `[P2 · Imaging · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`

## Open Product-Owner Decisions

- [x] POD-001 After reconnect: preserve session, park mount, or ask user?
  - *Decision:* Auto-park on reconnect — already the implemented behaviour in `RuntimeContext._build_adapters()`.
- [x] POD-002 Maximum acceptable STOP response time?
  - *Decision:* **< 1 s** — applies to mount slew abort and focuser stop. Used as acceptance bar for BUG-001 and the safety regression checklist.
- [x] POD-003 What state may the UI show after command acceptance but before hardware confirmation?
  - *Decision:* **Show spinner / pending indicator** — after a Park/Unpark/Home/GoTo command is accepted, the label shows a loading state until `DeviceStateService` confirms the new hardware state. Adds a UX task: see UX-PENDING-001 below.
- [x] POD-004 Is SDK camera index acceptable anywhere outside diagnostics?
  - *Decision:* SDK camera index is NOT acceptable in the product UI (enforced by R4). SDK camera index IS accepted in API request bodies for backward compatibility — `camera_role` is preferred. In Stage 6 diagnostics, `sdk_index` from camera scan results is shown and used (by design).
- [x] POD-005 Which failures may block the whole app, and which must degrade locally?
  - *Decision:* Per-feature isolation: camera RED → `can_preview=false`, mount RED → `can_goto=false`, ASTAP RED → `can_solve=false`, focuser RED → `can_autofocus=false`, storage RED → `can_save=false`. YELLOW items degrade, not block. `can_observe` requires all five plus `mode=real`.
  - *Done:* `ReadinessService._capability_flags()` + 5 new fields in `ReadinessReport`; 12 new tests in `TestCapabilityFlags`; blocked-capability chip row in readiness card.
- [x] POD-006 What is the minimum successful demo workflow?
  - *Decision:* **Guided single-target session** — Pick target → GoTo → plate-solve & center → autofocus → stack 10 frames → save. That is the MVP demo.
- [x] POD-007 What evidence is required for product-owner sign-off?
  - *Decision:* Pi hardware/app logs + saved FITS/output image + session JSON log. Evidence folder: one directory with timestamped app log, session JSON, and saved output image from a real hardware session.
- [x] POD-008 Which requirements are deferred beyond MVP?
  - *Decision:* Defer ISS tracking, multi-target queue, advanced calibration frames wizard, and deep collimation algorithm phases to post-MVP. Minimal collimation wizard UI shell (start/status/overlay) is part of the MVP demo.
- [x] POD-009 Concrete performance targets: preview latency, solve time, centering accuracy, Pi thermal ceiling?
  - *Decision (M6-001..006):* 6-hour unattended session; ≤2 s preview latency; ≤500 ms STOP response; ≤30 arcsec centering accuracy; ≥90% plate-solve success rate; ≤75°C Pi thermal ceiling. All targets tracked in `domain/performance_targets.py` and `GET /api/performance-targets`.
- [x] POD-010 Should SDK camera indices be forbidden in API request bodies, or only hidden in the UI? `[P2 · Process]`
  - *Decision:* `camera_role` is the preferred parameter for all product-facing API endpoints. `camera_index` is accepted for backward compatibility. New product UI code must use `camera_role`; diagnostic code may use `camera_index` directly.
  - *Done:* `deps.resolve_camera_index()` helper; `camera_role` added to solver/solve, calibration/bias|dark|flat|bpm|match, histogram/analyze; frontend setup.js/session.js/preview.js updated to send `camera_role` directly; 11 new tests in `TestResolveCameraIndex`, `TestSolverAcceptsCameraRole`, `TestHistogramAcceptsCameraRole`.

### UX-PENDING-001 — Command-pending indicator in mount/focuser UI `[P1 · UI]`

- [x] Mount card state badge shows spinner + `cmd…` while command is in flight
- [x] Mount strip state label shows `cmd…` while command is in flight
- [x] Dot turns yellow while pending; reverts to hardware-confirmed colour on next poll
- [x] `stale: true` from API shown as `⚠ state` badge / strip label suffix
- [x] `mountAction()`, `mountHome()`, `mountGoto()` all set/clear `_mountPendingCmd`
- [x] Card re-renders immediately on command acceptance (pending) and on poll confirmation (final)

## M7 — Formal Service Contracts & Safety Extension

*Source: `smarttscope_additional_requirements.md` v1.0 — ingested 2026-06-24*

### P0 — Safety behavioral change

- [x] M7-001 Interactive time/location startup dialog — replace silent auto-sync with user-confirmation flow `[P0 · Safety]`
  - Remove `ensure_time_location_synced()` call from `adapters/onstep/mount.py` `session_connect()`
  - After ST-002 query: compare OnStep time/location against GPS (fix ≤ 60 min old) or system/config fallback
  - Within tolerance → set `TimeLocationStatus = VERIFIED`, log, continue
  - Out of tolerance → show dialog (OnStep values, master values, differences, source); user: Approve → push via adapter; Skip → set `UNVERIFIED`
  - Tests: TEST-001 table (9 cases: within tolerance, time diff > 10 s, location diff > tolerance, approve push, reject push, unverified blocks tracking/GoTo/sync, startup while parked, startup while unparked, tracking disabled)

- [x] M7-002 Add `TimeLocationStatus` orthogonal flag to `DeviceStateService` `[P0 · Safety]`
  - New enum `TimeLocationStatus = {UNKNOWN, VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED}` in `smart_telescope/domain/`
  - Add field to `DeviceStateService`; default `UNKNOWN` at startup; set by M7-001 sequence
  - `HardwareCommandCoordinator.mount_command()` checks `TimeLocationStatus` before tracking enable, GoTo, sync
  - Camera-only and manual movement (with warning) remain permitted when `UNVERIFIED`
  - Config flags from CFG-001 (`allow_*_when_time_location_unverified`) respected

- [x] M7-011 GPS fix age check ≤ 60 minutes (CFG-002) `[P2 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-24
  - `GpsdFix.fix_age_s` + `is_fresh(max_age_minutes=60)`; stale fix logs WARNING; API response exposes `fix_age_s` + `is_fresh`; 6 new tests

- [x] M7-012 Verify retry limits in all service loops (SAFE-004) `[P2 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-24

## M8 — Incident-Driven Runtime Hardening

*Source: `resources/hlrequirements/smarttscope_incident_requirements_final_v1_2.md` v1.2 — ingested 2026-06-25*  
*Resolves: INC-001..INC-012 (field incidents); covers REQ-STATE, REQ-TIME, REQ-CONN, REQ-GOTO, REQ-CMD, REQ-UI, REQ-SETUP, REQ-PS, REQ-AG, REQ-LOG, REQ-FRAME, REQ-CLICK, REQ-API, REQ-GIT*

**Grilling clarifications (binding):**
- Push Pi time → OnStep verified → ONSTEP_COMPARISON is a valid trust chain (intentional; document in code comment)
- REQ-AG-002 tracking quality = star elongation/FWHM from captured frames only, no plate-solve dependency
- Click-to-center cold start = hard block + launch calibration wizard; no manual override
- REQ-GIT items tracked here as Priority 7

### Priority 1 — State model and operation gates

- [x] M8-001 Separate `/api/status` into 6 state categories `[P1 · API]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - `adapter_connection_state`, `adapter_health_state`, `mount_operational_state`, `onstep_time_location_state`, `raspberry_time_trust_state`, `operation_gate_states`
  - Acceptance: REQ-STATE-001; INC-001 (connected-but-restricted no longer shown as disconnected)

- [x] M8-002 Mount readiness enum — 7 states `[P1 · Domain]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - `DISCONNECTED`, `CONNECTED_HEALTH_UNKNOWN`, `CONNECTED_RESTRICTED`, `CONNECTED_READY`, `CONNECTED_TIME_LOCATION_UNVERIFIED`, `CONNECTED_RASPBERRY_TIME_UNTRUSTED`, `ERROR`
  - Trust/time failures shown as trust failures, not connection failures; reconnect guidance only when reconnecting helps
  - Acceptance: REQ-STATE-002, REQ-CONN-003; TEST-001

- [x] M8-003 `OperationGateService` with 13 gated operations `[P1 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - Operations: `camera_capture`, `manual_mount_move`, `tracking_enable`, `goto`, `bright_star_goto`, `sync`, `plate_solve`, `plate_solve_mount_correction`, `collimation_preview`, `collimation_slew_to_target`, `collimation_mount_centering`, `autofocus`, `click_to_center`
  - Gate response: `allowed`, `reason_code`, `human_message`, `required_user_action`, `blocking_states`
  - HTTP 409 uses gate result; rejected commands not logged as issued
  - Acceptance: REQ-STATE-003; TEST-003

- [x] M8-004 Fix `/api/mount/status` — `connected = adapter_open AND health_check_ok` `[P1 · API]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - `adapter_open`, `health_check_ok`, `connected`, `park_state`, `tracking_state`, `last_error`
  - Connect All idempotent: repeated calls reuse existing connections without contradictory UI state
  - Acceptance: REQ-CONN-001, REQ-CONN-002, REQ-API-002; INC-001

- [x] M8-005 UI — disabled controls show exact gate reason; 409 includes structured diagnostics `[P1 · UI]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - Applies to: goto, bright_star_goto, sync, tracking_enable, plate_solve, plate_solve_correction, collimation_slew_to_target, click_to_center, autofocus
  - Reason from backend gate result; UI refreshes after Stage 1 changes; stale frontend state cannot keep controls disabled
  - Rejected GoTo logged as `REJECTED` not `ISSUED`
  - Acceptance: REQ-UI-001, REQ-GOTO-001; INC-003, INC-005
  - Backend: `_gate_check()` in `mount.py`; `gate_inputs_from_device_state()`+`evaluate_gate()` in `operation_gate.py`; replaced all 4 M7-002 ad-hoc tl checks
  - Frontend: `_gateStates`+`_applyGateStates()` in `app.js`; `refreshHealth()` stores gate states; `_updateMountStrip()` calls `_applyGateStates()`; gate-blocked parsing in `mountGoto()`/`mountAction()` catch blocks
  - raspberry_time_trust stub changed to "TRUSTED" until M8-007

### Priority 2 — Stage 1 time/location and Raspberry trust

- [x] M8-006 Master source selection: GPS > NTP > USER_CONFIRMED > fallback `[P1 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - Fallback (untrusted time, config-only location) does not unlock mount automation
  - Master source visible in UI and logs
  - Acceptance: REQ-TIME-001
  - `domain/master_time_source.py`: `MasterTimeSource` enum (GPS_FIX | NTP | USER_CONFIRMED | FALLBACK)
  - `services/master_source.py`: `MasterSourceService.evaluate()` priority chain; `_check_ntp_sync()` via timedatectl; `is_trusted()` staticmethod
  - `services/device_state.py`: `is_user_time_confirmed()` / `set_user_time_confirmed()` flag
  - `services/operation_gate.py`: `gate_inputs_from_device_state()` accepts optional `master_source_svc`; adds `master_time_source` key; `_evaluate_one()`/`evaluate_gate()`/`evaluate_all_gates()` accept `**_` for extra inputs
  - `api/health.py`: `MountStateCategories.master_time_source` field; `system_status` injects `MasterSourceService` via deps
  - `api/mount.py`: `_gate_check()` accepts `master_source_svc`; 4 gated endpoints inject it
  - `api/deps.py` + `runtime.py`: `get_master_source_service()` dep; `RuntimeContext.master_source_svc` (reset in tests)
  - 23 new tests in `tests/unit/services/test_master_source.py`; 3368 passed, 39 skipped

- [x] M8-007 Raspberry Pi time trust sources — 5 enums with rules `[P1 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-27
  - `NTP`, `GPSD_FIX`, `USER_CONFIRMED`, `ONSTEP_COMPARISON`, `NOT_TRUSTED`
  - `ONSTEP_COMPARISON`: valid only if OnStep trusted via GPS/NTP/previous verified Stage 1 **or** via successful push in current session (intentional trust chain — clarify in code comment per DEC-006)
  - Pushing Pi time to OnStep alone does NOT auto-trust Raspberry Pi time (trust needs the subsequent re-comparison step)
  - `USER_CONFIRMED`: warning shown; logged; valid for session or `session_trust_expiry_minutes`
  - Acceptance: REQ-TIME-002, REQ-TIME-004; INC-003, INC-009
  - `domain/raspberry_time_trust.py`: `RaspberryTimeTrustSource` enum + `is_trusted()` helper
  - `services/raspberry_time_trust.py`: `RaspberryTimeTrustService` with priority chain (GPSD_FIX > NTP > ONSTEP_COMPARISON > USER_CONFIRMED > NOT_TRUSTED); expiry via monotonic timestamp
  - `services/device_state.py`: added `set_onstep_comparison_established()`, `get_onstep_comparison_established_at()`, `get_user_time_confirmed_at()`
  - `services/operation_gate.py`: M8-007 path with isinstance guards for mock safety; M8-006 fallback when `raspberry_trust_svc=None`
  - `api/health.py`, `api/mount.py`, `api/deps.py`, `runtime.py`: wired into all gated endpoints
  - 35 new tests in `tests/unit/services/test_raspberry_time_trust.py`; 3360 passed, 24 skipped

- [x] M8-008 Meter-based location tolerance (100 m default); UTF-8-safe logs `[P1 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-27
  - Primary check: `location_delta_m ≤ onstep_location_tolerance_m (default 100)`; degree fallback only for backward-compat
  - Active tolerances logged on every check; `lat_delta=0.0027°` fails at 100 m; `lon_delta=0.0337°` fails at 100 m
  - No mojibake (`窶・`, `竊・`, `ﾂｰ`) in logs; degree values as `°` or ASCII `deg`
  - Acceptance: REQ-TIME-003, REQ-TIME-006; INC-002; TEST-002
  - `adapters/onstep/safety.py`: added `onstep_time_tolerance_s=10.0` and `onstep_location_tolerance_m=100.0` to `OnStepSafetyConfig`
  - `adapters/onstep/mount.py`: added `_haversine_m()` helper; `get_sync_status()` uses meter-based tolerance, adds `location_delta_m`/`location_tolerance_m`/`time_tolerance_s` to returned dict
  - `api/session.py`: log format uses `deg` not `°`; active tolerances logged on every check
  - `services/readiness.py`: location issue string uses `{loc_m:.0f}m`; fallback uses `deg`
  - `config.py`: `ONSTEP_TIME_TOLERANCE_S`/`ONSTEP_LOCATION_TOLERANCE_M` from `[mount]` section; wired into `build_onstep_safety_config()`
  - `templates/config.toml`: added `[mount]` section with tolerance stubs
  - 26 new tests in `tests/unit/adapters/onstep/test_get_sync_status.py`; 3386 passed, 24 skipped

- [x] M8-009 Trust session expiry; no cross-restart persistence `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - `config.py`: `SESSION_TRUST_EXPIRY_MINUTES` from `[time_location]` section (env override supported)
  - `runtime.py`: both `__init__` and `reset_for_tests()` pass `session_trust_expiry_minutes=config.SESSION_TRUST_EXPIRY_MINUTES`; added `from . import config`
  - `templates/config.toml`: activated `[time_location]` section with `session_trust_expiry_minutes = 120` and `persist_trust_across_restart = false`
  - 5 new M8-009 tests (no-persistence, restart-clears-trust, custom-expiry, 120-min-default, USER_CONFIRMED expiry); 3391 passed, 24 skipped
  - Acceptance: DEC-004 (no cross-restart persistence), DEC-005 (configurable expiry)

- [x] M8-010 Stage 1 UI panel — 20 required fields `[P1 · UI]`
  - `GET /api/stage1/time-location` (REQ-API-004): consolidated time/location trust state from DeviceStateService cache; no live serial I/O
  - `POST /api/mount/confirm_time`: user asserts Pi clock is correct → sets USER_CONFIRMED trust
  - `DeviceStateService`: 3 new cache fields (`_last_sync_status`, `_last_verification_at`, `_last_push_at`) + 5 accessors
  - `mount.get_sync_status()` extended with `onstep_time_local` / `master_time_local` ISO strings
  - Stage 1 card "Time / Location Verification" in UI: adapter state, trust source, time/location deltas vs tolerances, action buttons (Rerun / Push / Confirm Pi Time)
  - JS: `refreshStage1TL()`, `stage1PushClock()`, `stage1ConfirmTime()` in `setup.js`; 15 s poll interval in `app.js`
  - 25 new tests (19 `test_stage1.py` + 2 `test_mount.py` + 4 `test_raspberry_time_trust.py`); 3416 passed, 24 skipped
  - Acceptance: REQ-TIME-005, REQ-API-004, INC-009

  - Modes: `PLATE_SOLVE`, `DSO`, `PLANET`, `MOON`, `COLLIMATION`, `AUTOFOCUS`
  - `PLATE_SOLVE`: keep offset low; increase exposure while tracking quality supports it (measured by star elongation ratio / FWHM growth from captured frames — no plate-solve dependency)
  - Acceptance: REQ-AG-001, REQ-AG-002; INC-008

- [ ] M8-023 Exposure capability test + 13-field auto-gain diagnostics `[P2 · Runtime]`
  - Test sequence: `0.5 s, 1 s, 2 s, 4 s, 8 s`; stop on elongation/FWHM degradation/saturation
  - Diagnostics: `number_of_stars_detected`, `background_median_adu`, `background_stddev_adu`, `saturated_pixel_ratio`, `black_clipped_pixel_ratio`, `median_fwhm_px`, `median_hfr_px`, `exposure_limit_reached`, `gain_limit_reached`, `offset_limit_reached`, `tracking_blur_suspected`, `reason_for_next_step`, `reason_for_stop`
  - Suggested values not written to config without user confirmation (OPEN-004: revisit after real tracking data)
  - Acceptance: REQ-AG-003, REQ-AG-004

### Priority 6 — Collimation and click-to-center

- [ ] M8-024 Collimation modes: "Bahtinov Preview" + "Defocus Donut" (correct spelling) `[P2 · UI]`
  - Both modes visible; if unavailable, reason shown; "Bahtinov" spelling verified
  - Collimation preview allowed without Raspberry Pi time trust if camera capture works
  - Slew-to-target and mount-assisted centering remain gated
  - Acceptance: REQ-UI-002, REQ-UI-003; INC-006, INC-007; TEST-005

- [ ] M8-025 Click-to-center in collimation, plate-solve, autofocus views `[P2 · UI]`
  - User can click star or donut; if unavailable, exact reason shown
  - Acceptance: REQ-CLICK-001

- [ ] M8-026 Click refinement — star centroid / donut-circle center / raw fallback `[P2 · Runtime]`
  - Raw click logged; refined target logged and displayed; if refinement fails, user can use raw click or cancel
  - Acceptance: REQ-CLICK-002

- [ ] M8-027 Click-to-center calibration (hard block; calibration wizard on cold start) `[P2 · Runtime]`
  - Missing/stale calibration blocks movement and launches calibration wizard (no manual override — grilling clarification #3)
  - Calibration stored per optical-train × camera-orientation × binning; invalidated on change
  - Mount not moved without valid calibration
  - Acceptance: REQ-CLICK-003

- [ ] M8-028 Iterative bounded click-to-center loop `[P2 · Runtime]`
  - Config defaults: `max_iterations=5`, `center_tolerance_px=20`, `max_single_move_px=300`, `start_with_fraction_of_calculated_move=0.5`, `allow_when_tracking_off=true`, `allow_when_parked=false`
  - Works tracking-on; works tracking-off with drift warning; blocked while parked; user can cancel; every iteration logged
  - OPEN-002: review defaults after first calibration results on real mount
  - Acceptance: REQ-CLICK-004, DEC-010..012; TEST-005

### Priority 7 — Dev workflow: GitHub delivery audit

- [ ] M8-029 `scripts/delivery_audit.py` — git delivery checks `[P3 · DevWorkflow]`
  - Runs: `git status --short`, `git diff --stat`, `git log -1 --stat`, `git branch --show-current`, `git remote -v`
  - Confirms branch, commit, source/test/doc file categories, push result
  - Acceptance: REQ-GIT-002; INC-012; TEST-007

- [ ] M8-030 Delivery log JSONL + pre-push checklist `[P3 · DevWorkflow]`
  - Fields: `timestamp`, `branch`, `commit_hash`, `commit_message`, `files_changed`, `source_files_changed`, `test_files_changed`, `docs_changed`, `push_result`, `remote_url`
  - Documentation-only commits not marked implementation-complete
  - OPEN-005: split this requirements doc into runtime/UI/diagnostics/delivery after M8 closure
  - Acceptance: REQ-GIT-001, REQ-GIT-003

## Safety Regression Checklist

*Run before every milestone demo and release. STOP response time target: **< 1 s** (POD-002).*

- [ ] STOP works during mount slew — response confirmed < 1 s on real hardware
- [ ] STOP works during focuser movement — response confirmed < 1 s on real hardware
- [ ] Shutdown stops motion before disconnect
- [ ] Park label follows observed hardware state (not command receipt)
- [ ] Unpark label follows observed hardware state (not command receipt)
- [ ] New mount command rejected while unsafe movement is active
- [ ] New focuser command rejected while prior movement is still active
- [ ] Preview failure does not affect mount/focuser controls
- [ ] Autogain cancellation exits within agreed timeout
- [ ] Session stop exits within agreed timeout
- [ ] Camera conflicts detected and reported
- [ ] Missing config files produce actionable diagnostics
