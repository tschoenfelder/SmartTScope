## OnStepAdapter Migration — 2026-06-14

All mount and focuser hardware communication now flows exclusively through the external `onstep_adapter` package (tschoenfelder/OnStepAdapter). `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/` is an override layer — it subclasses the pip-installed package; it does NOT contain a hand-rolled copy. See `SYNC.md` for sync state, active SYNC-OVERRIDEs, and upgrade procedure.

### Completed (initial migration to pip-installed package)

- [x] Install `onstep_adapter` wheel and register in `SYNC.md` as external module
- [x] Sync 9 implementation files from OnStepAdapter GitHub into `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/`
- [x] Add `build_onstep_safety_config()` to `config.py` — bridges config.toml → `OnStepSafetyConfig`
- [x] Update `runtime.py` to use `OnStepClient` lifecycle with safety config
- [x] SYNC-OVERRIDE: add `move(direction, move_ms)` to `OnStepMount` delegating to `guide()` (REQ-1 interim)
- [x] Surface `safety_lock` as `safety_violation` in `MountStatus` API response
- [x] Handle `OnStepSafetyError` in `mount_operations.py` (imported with fallback) and return HTTP 409 from goto
- [x] `MountObservedState` extended with `safety_violation` field; poll loop populates from adapter

### Upgrade to v0.3.0 — 2026-06-17

Release: <https://github.com/tschoenfelder/OnStepAdapter/releases/tag/v0.3.0>

- [x] ONS3-001 Update `pyproject.toml` wheel URL to v0.3.0 `[P1 · Build]`
  - *Done:* `onstep-adapter @ .../v0.3.0/onstep_adapter-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl` already in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] ONS3-002 Install new wheel: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and confirm `onstep_adapter.__version__ == "0.3.0"` `[P1 · Build]`
  - *Done:* version confirmed 0.3.0; `onstep_adapter.__init__.py` is a re-export shim pointing to `smart_telescope.adapters.onstep.*`
- [x] ONS3-003 Review each REQ-ST-* override in `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/mount.py` — check if v0.3.0 base class now handles any of them and remove those that are no longer needed `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* All REQ-ST-001..007 overrides must stay — upstream v0.3.0 is a re-export shim with no independent implementation; overrides are permanent until upstream adds real implementations
- [x] ONS3-004 Review `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/client.py` — its `__init__` replicates the base `OnStepClient.__init__` body; update if upstream signature changed `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `client.py` is SmartTScope-owned complete implementation; no upstream signature change; no action needed
- [x] ONS3-005 Run full unit test suite: `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -x -q` — all tests pass `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 2942 passed, 24 skipped (2026-06-21); fixed 4 classes of pre-existing failures found during run: ArchiveConfig default, catalog/star-selector HA filtering not patched in tests, park tests missing `confirmed=True`, stretch test expected percentile behavior from sigma-stretch
- [x] ONS3-006 Commit: `git commit -m "chore: upgrade onstep_adapter to v0.3.0"` `[P1 · Build]`
  - *Done:* committed 2026-06-21

### Open Enhancement Requests (pending external delivery — tracked in SYNC.md)

- [ ] REQ-1: `move(direction, move_ms)` at slew rate in `OnStepMount` — interim delegates to `guide()`
- [ ] REQ-2: `get_park_position() → MountPosition | None` and `set_park_position() → bool` — **stays in SmartTScope shim** (v0.3.0 already has `set_park_position_from_current()` and `get_stored_park_position()`; these two wrappers adapt to `MountPort` signatures)
- [ ] REQ-3: Sticky AT_HOME state tracking in adapter (currently in `DeviceStateService`)
- [ ] REQ-4: Hardware watchdog property on `OnStepMount` (currently in `DeviceStateService`)
- [ ] REQ-5: Command audit trail properties on `OnStepMount` (currently in `DeviceStateService`)

### Replace SmartTScope adapter reimplementation with pip package

`smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/mount.py` is 4,408 lines. The goal is to delete it and reduce the adapter layer to a ≤30-line shim that satisfies `MountPort`/`FocuserPort` ABC compliance while delegating all logic to `onstep_adapter`.

**Architecture reality (discovered 2026-06-17):** `onstep_adapter` v0.3.0 is NOT an independent library. Its `__init__.py` consists entirely of `from smart_telescope.adapters.onstep.* import ...` — it re-exports SmartTScope's own code. The only files in the package are `__init__.py` and two smoke-test tools. There is no independent `_BaseMount`. All methods (REQ-1, REQ-ST-001..007) already "exist" in v0.3.0 only because they exist in SmartTScope's own adapter layer.

**What this means:** The migration is blocked on creating an **independent codebase** in the OnStepAdapter repo. The upstream work is not "add these methods" but "implement the full adapter independently so SmartTScope can import from it without circular dependency". REQ-1 and REQ-ST-001..007 describe the methods that independent implementation must include.

REQ-2 is NOT an upstream requirement — `set_park_position()` and `get_park_position()` stay permanently in the shim as `MountPort` interface adapters over the existing `set_park_position_from_current()` / `get_stored_park_position()` methods.

**End state:** `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/` contains only a thin `OnStepMount(_PipMount, MountPort): pass` shim. No LX200 commands, no serial bus logic, no method implementations remain in this repo.

#### Phase 0 — Upstream contributions (must happen first)

File the following as issues/PRs on `tschoenfelder/OnStepAdapter`:

| ID | Upstream ask | Reasoning |
|----|-------------|-----------|
| REQ-1 | `move(direction, move_ms) → bool` in `_BaseMount` | MountPort contract; generic center-rate timed move for any GEM user. |
| ~~REQ-2~~ | ~~`set_park_position() → bool`~~ | **NOT upstream** — v0.3.0 already has `set_park_position_from_current()` and `get_stored_park_position()`; SmartTScope's `set_park_position()` and `get_park_position()` are thin `MountPort`-compliance wrappers that stay in the shim. |
| REQ-ST-001 | `ensure_time_location_synced()` | Pre-observation clock+location sync is needed by every OnStep client. |
| REQ-ST-002 | `confirmed_by_user` param in `sync_onstep_time_location()` sets `time_trust_source="user_confirmed"` | Safety trust tracking — any safety-aware client needs this to clear clock locks. |
| REQ-ST-003 | `_explicit_tracking_started` flag in `get_state()` prevents ``:hR#`` auto-tracking from masking AT_HOME | Firmware quirk (auto-tracking after unpark) affects all GEM OnStep users. |
| REQ-ST-004 | `enable_tracking()` at-home bypass skips HA/altitude checks when HOME RA is stale | GEM HOME-position safety; stale RA produces false limit blocks at HOME. |
| REQ-ST-005 | `disable_tracking_verified()` clears `_explicit_tracking_started` | Correctness: without the clear, `get_state()` returns TRACKING forever after verified disable. |
| REQ-ST-006 | `stop()` / `park()` / `unpark()` each clear `_explicit_tracking_started` | Same flag lifecycle issue — all state-changing commands must reset the flag. |
| REQ-ST-007 | `motion_safety_preflight()` pier-side guards: (a) `terminal_state` check; (b) suppress stale `:Gm#` when `axis2 < 15°` at HOME | GEM safety refinement; stale pier-side blocks valid GoTo at CWD home position. |

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-001 File upstream issue: REQ-1 `move(direction, move_ms) → bool` `[P1 · External]`
- [x] ONS-MIGRATE-002 ~~File upstream: REQ-2~~ — v0.3.0 already has `set_park_position_from_current()` + `get_stored_park_position()`; shim methods stay in SmartTScope (MountPort ABC compliance only) `[P1 · External]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-003 File upstream issues: REQ-ST-001..007 (flag lifecycle, pier-side guards, at-home bypass, confirmed_by_user sync) `[P1 · External]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-004 Confirm upstream release incorporating the above; update `pyproject.toml` wheel URL `[P1 · Build]`

#### Phase 1 — Audit (after upstream release)

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-005 Install new wheel; verify each REQ-ST-* is now in the base class; mark covered overrides for deletion `[P1 · Runtime]`

#### Phase 2 — Reduce adapter layer

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-006 Replace `mount.py` (4,408 lines) with shim: `class OnStepMount(_PipMount, MountPort): pass` plus any REQ-* override bodies not yet in upstream `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-007 Reduce or delete `client.py`; if upstream `OnStepClient` injects its own mount, remove shim class entirely `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-008 Delete 6 thin re-export files (`results.py`, `safety.py`, `serial_bus.py`, `state_store.py`, `firmware_proof.py`, `focuser.py`); update `__init__.py` to re-export from `onstep_adapter.*` `[P2 · Runtime]`
- [x] ONS-MIGRATE-009 Update import sites: `runtime.py`, `config.py`, `api/mount.py`, `services/mount_operations.py` — all now import from `adapters.onstep` package `__init__.py`, not internal submodules. Dead `OnStepSafetyError` import removed from `mount_operations.py`. Defensive `try/except ImportError` removed from `api/mount.py` and `mount_operations.py`. Ready for final rename to `from onstep_adapter import ...` once upstream is independent. `[P1 · Runtime]`

#### Phase 2b — Consumer API migration (no direct serial communication in api/ or services/)

- [x] ONS-MIGRATE-009b `FocuserPort` extended with `status() → FocuserStatus` and `move_absolute() → FocuserMoveResult`; `FocuserStatus`/`FocuserMoveResult` dataclasses defined in `ports/focuser.py` (canonical); `results.py` re-exports. `api/focuser.py` uses `focuser.status()` + `focuser.move_absolute()` — no individual property calls, no direct serial access. `MockFocuser`, `SimulatorFocuser` updated. 2942 tests pass. `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-009c (optional) Extend `MountPort` similarly with structured status call once mount-side richer API is defined upstream. `[P3 · Runtime]`

#### Phase 3 — Verify and close (after upstream independent implementation)

- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-010 Run full unit test suite: `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -x -q` — all pass `[P1 · Tests]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-011 Verify: `smart_telescope/adapters/onstep/mount.py` ≤ 30 lines; no `serial_bus` implementations remain in the adapter layer `[P1 · Process]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-012 Hardware smoke-test on Pi: connect → GoTo → STOP → park/unpark — all succeed with no regression `[P1 · Hardware]`
- [ ] ONS-MIGRATE-013 Commit and update `SYNC.md` to reflect shim-only state `[P1 · Build]`

## M1 — Hardware Safety Spine

*System controls moving parts predictably and can stop safely.*

### P0 Safety — Fix immediately

- [x] BUG-023 Shutdown with CTRL-C does not close OnStep connection; focuser keeps moving in small steps after exit `[P0 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* shutdown sequence stops motion and closes serial before process exits; verified on real Pi
  - *Done:* `RuntimeContext.shutdown()` calls `focuser.stop()` then `mount.stop()` then `mount.disconnect()` in lifespan teardown
- [x] BUG-005 Any component crash must not release control of mount or focuser; STOP must always respond `[P0 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Acceptance:* preview/camera failure does not affect mount/focuser control; STOP always completes within agreed time
  - *Done:* `_session_thread()` wraps `runner.run()` in a `finally` that calls `rt.job_manager.release()`; STOP endpoint calls `mount.stop()` directly (no coordinator); 10 explicit isolation tests in `tests/unit/api/test_bug005_isolation.py` — coordinator lock bypass, resource release on crash, STOP/goto available post-crash

### R1 — Hardware Command Coordinator

- [x] R1-001 Define `HardwareCommandCoordinator` `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-002 Define command types: stop, goto, park, unpark, home, guide, focuser move, focuser nudge `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-003 Define command priority rules `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-004 Make STOP priority higher than all normal commands `[P0 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* STOP endpoints call mount/focuser directly, never through coordinator
- [x] R1-005 Define command lifecycle states `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done (R2-003+R2-005):* Lifecycle is: command issued (record_command) → hardware executing (convergence helpers poll cached state) → done or error (record_command_error + observed state change); exposed in MountStatus.last_command/last_command_error
- [x] R1-006 Add command IDs and structured command logs `[P2 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-007 Move mount/focuser endpoint-local locks into coordinator `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `_goto_lock` removed from `mount.py`, `_move_lock` removed from `focuser.py`; all commands use `coordinator.mount_command()` / `coordinator.focuser_command()`
- [x] R1-008 Introduce OnStep serial bus abstraction `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-009 Stop exposing private mount serial methods to focuser adapter `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R1-010 Add concurrency, timeout, and STOP-priority tests `[P1 · Tests]`

- [ ] R1-011 Hardware verification: STOP during mount slew and STOP during focuser move `[P0 · Hardware]`
  - *Must have hardware evidence — not accepted on mock alone*

### R2 — Device State Service

- [x] R2-001 Define `DeviceStateService` `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R2-002 Define observed mount, focuser, and camera state models `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `MountObservedState` dataclass with state, ra, dec, polled_at, error
- [x] R2-003 Track last command, last observed state timestamp, and last error per device `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `DeviceStateService.record_command(name)`, `record_command_error(msg)`, `get_last_command()` added; all mount command endpoints (park, unpark, goto, home, track, stop) call `record_command` before issuing; errors recorded on failure; `MountStatus` response includes `last_command`, `last_command_age_s`, `last_command_error`; 4 new tests in `test_device_state.py`
- [x] R2-004 Poll mount and focuser state at controlled interval `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* background daemon thread polls every 2 s via `DeviceStateService`
- [x] R2-005 Add state convergence helpers for park, unpark, home, and goto completion `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `wait_for_mount_state(target, timeout_s)` waits until cached state equals target; `wait_while_mount_state(current, timeout_s)` waits until cached state differs; `mount_unpark` uses `wait_while_mount_state(PARKED)` to replace direct poll loop; `mount_park` uses `wait_for_mount_state(PARKED)` to confirm within 5 s; 6 new tests in `test_device_state.py`
- [x] R2-006 Add stale-state and slow-response detection `[P2 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `MountObservedState.is_stale()` uses 10 s threshold; `stale` field in `MountStatus`
- [x] R2-007 Change status endpoints and UI labels to use observed state `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `GET /api/mount/status` reads from `DeviceStateService` cache; falls back to direct poll only when cache is empty
- [x] R2-008 Test: command accepted but observed state unchanged `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 13 tests in `tests/unit/services/test_device_state.py` — poll lifecycle, stale detection, error propagation, position-skip on UNKNOWN, thread-safety

### Field bugs — Mount state

- [x] BUG-011 Park command moves mount but UNPARKED flag remains too long `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* UI label changes only after observed state confirms park; correct within 5 s
  - *Done:* `device_state.poll_now()` after park command refreshes cache immediately; frontend park poll loop extended from 10×500ms to 60×1000ms (60 s total — covers full park slew duration)
- [x] BUG-012 After reconnect, mount shown as unparked when policy requires parked `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `RuntimeContext.connect_devices()` calls `device_state.poll_now()` immediately after `start()` — cache populated from first millisecond of startup, no 2 s gap
- [x] BUG-016 Unpark returns HTTP 200 but label stays PARKED `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* label follows observed hardware state, not command receipt
  - *Done:* `device_state.poll_now()` after unpark command; timeout extended from 3 s to 5 s; frontend unpark loop extended to 20×500ms (10 s)

### Milestone M1 tasks

- [x] M1-001 Complete R1 hardware command coordinator `[P0 · Runtime]`

- [ ] M1-006 Verify STOP during focuser move (hardware evidence) `[P0 · Hardware]`
- [ ] M1-007 Verify shutdown during active motion (hardware evidence) `[P0 · Hardware]`

**Quality gate:** STOP works during mount slew and focuser movement. Shutdown leaves hardware controlled. Park/unpark UI follows observed state.

- [x] R0-006 Move autogain job reference into `RuntimeContext` or `JobManager` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `autogain_lock`, `_autogain_job` in RuntimeContext; `autogain.py` uses `_get_job()` / `_set_job()` wrappers; `reset_for_tests()` clears both
- [x] R0-007 Add explicit `shutdown()`, `connect_devices()`, `disconnect_devices()`, `reset_for_tests()` methods `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R0-008 Update API dependencies to read from app runtime `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R0-009 Keep compatibility wrappers during migration `[P2 · Runtime]`
- [x] R0-010 Add lifecycle tests `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 40 tests in `tests/unit/test_runtime.py` — init state, connect_devices (mock + simulator + idempotency + polling starts), shutdown (focuser stop, mount stop-before-disconnect, preview cameras, error tolerance), reset_for_tests (all cleared, session/autogain cleared, new adapters on next access), module singleton (get/set_runtime), session state management, autogain state management, FastAPI lifespan smoke tests
- [x] R0-011 Change `VerticalSliceRunner.run()` to not disconnect adapters in `finally`; release job ownership only; keep hardware live after session `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* removed `mount.disconnect()`, `camera.disconnect()`, `focuser.disconnect()` from `runner.py finally`; runtime shutdown sequence owns all device teardown; `test_run_does_not_disconnect_focuser_on_completion` verifies new contract

### R3 — Shared Job Manager

- [x] R3-001 Define `JobManager`, `Job`, `JobStatus`, `ResourceConflictError` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `smart_telescope/services/job_manager.py` — two modes: `submit()` (fully managed thread) and `claim()`/`release()` (caller-managed); timeout via companion daemon thread
- [x] R3-002 Define resource ownership model for camera, mount, focuser `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* convention: `"camera:N"`, `"mount"`, `"focuser"`; conflict check is atomic in `_register()`
- [x] R3-003 Add job status and cancellation APIs `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `cancel()`, `cancel_by_name()`, `cancel_all()`, `get_job()`, `get_by_name()`, `list_active()`, `active_resources()`, `is_resource_held()`, `purge_finished()`
- [x] R3-004 Migrate autogain to job manager `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `autogain.py` uses `rt.job_manager.submit("autogain", {"camera:N"}, _worker, ..., cancel_event=job.cancel, timeout_s=300)`; `ResourceConflictError` → 409
- [x] R3-005 Prevent session/autogain from competing for same camera/mount/focuser `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `session.py` uses `rt.job_manager.claim("session", {"camera:0", "mount", "focuser"})`; thread wrapper calls `release()` in finally; `ResourceConflictError` → 409
- [x] R3-006 Add cancellation checkpoints and timeouts `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* timeout watcher in `_start_timeout_watcher()`; autogain timeout 300 s; `cancel_event` bridge between `_Job.cancel` and JobManager
- [x] R3-007 Tests: cancellation, resource conflict, failure isolation `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 40 tests in `tests/unit/services/test_job_manager.py` — submit/claim/release lifecycle, resource conflicts, cancellation (by id/name/all), timeout, query API, purge

### Field bugs — Jobs and concurrency

- [x] BUG-001 Autogain cancel does not stop for a long time `[P1 · Runtime · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Acceptance:* cancel completes within < 1 s of the cancel request (POD-002 decision)
  - *Done:* `CaptureAbortedError` + `abort_capture()` in `CameraPort`; ToupcamCamera polls `_frame_ready` every 50ms and breaks on `_abort` event; AutoGainService spawns an abort-watcher thread that calls `camera.abort_capture()` as soon as `cancellation_flag` is set; catches `CaptureAbortedError` → CANCELLED. Cancel latency ≤ 50ms. Two regression tests in `test_autogain_service.py::TestCancelLatency`.
- [x] BUG-002b Preview shows `AUTO_GAIN_POSSIBLE_FOCUS_OR_POINTING_ERROR` after autogain cancel `[P2 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
- [x] BUG-019 Focuser nudge returns 409 conflict and blocks far too long; rapid +20 presses mostly rejected `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* conflict cleared within 2 s; sequential presses each produce movement
  - *Done:* `_safe_move` moved `time.sleep(0.3)` and `started` check outside the coordinator lock; lock now covers only serial command (~50-100 ms), not the started-check sleep
- [x] BUG-022 Changing camera in Goto/Solve then pressing Find Best fails; WebSocket data transfer error logged `[P1 · Runtime · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* Added `mountGotoAndCenter()` JS function (was called but never defined); `onPreviewCamChange()` now stops/restarts preview WS on camera change

### Milestone M2 tasks

- [x] M2-001 Complete R0 runtime context `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] M2-002 Complete R3 shared job manager `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] M2-003 Define camera-use policy `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* convention `"camera:N"` / `"mount"` / `"focuser"` in JobManager; session claims `camera:0 + mount + focuser`; autogain claims `camera:{index}`; preview uses camera adapter's `_capture_lock` (serializes at hardware level); full role-based policy deferred to R4
- [x] M2-004 Prevent preview/autogain/session conflicts `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* session/autogain conflicts explicit via R3 `ResourceConflictError` → HTTP 409; preview serializes through adapter-level `_capture_lock`; concurrent preview + autogain on same camera serializes safely
- [x] M2-005 Add timeout policy for long-running jobs `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* autogain: 300 s timeout via JobManager companion watcher; session: user-initiated stop only (legitimate sessions run hours — hard timeout not appropriate)
- [x] M2-006 Ensure unrelated subsystems continue when one job fails `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* JobManager releases resources on DONE/FAILED/CANCELLED; `ResourceConflictError` is synchronous (caller gets 409, other subsystems unaffected)

**Quality gate:** Autogain cancel and session stop complete within agreed timeout. Camera conflicts are explicit. API exposes current job state and last error.

## M3 — Smart Setup and Optical Train Truth

*System knows the actual telescope setup and can tell the user whether it is ready.*

### R4 — Optical Train Registry

- [x] R4-001 Define `OpticalTrain` and `OpticalTrainRegistry` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `OpticalTrain` frozen dataclass + `OpticalTrainRegistry` with `from_config()`, `get()`, `main()`, `guide()`, `all()`, `by_camera_index()`, `by_camera_role()` — `smart_telescope/services/optical_train_registry.py`
- [x] R4-002 Include camera role, serial/logical name, focuser binding, cooling capability, pixel scale, solver profile `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `OpticalTrain` has `camera_role`, `camera_index`, `telescope_name`, `focal_mm`, `reducer_factor`, `pixel_scale_arcsec`, `has_focuser`, `focuser`; pixel scale priority: explicit TOML → derived from camera profile pixel_um → global fallback
- [x] R4-003 Load train definitions from config `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `OpticalTrainSpec` in config.py with `_parse_telescopes()` + `_parse_optical_trains()`; `[telescopes]` and `[optical_trains]` sections added to `templates/config.toml`
- [x] R4-004 Validate train definitions at startup `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `from_config()` collects all errors and raises `ValueError` listing every broken telescope/camera reference; `RuntimeContext.get_optical_train_registry()` catches errors and returns empty registry
- [x] R4-005 Replace product-facing camera index selection with train/role selection `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* All camera `<select>` elements now show train names ("main — c8", "guide — guide_scope"); values are train name strings; `_loadSelectFromTrains()` replaces `_loadSelectFromCameras()` for all camera selects; focuser autofocus select filters to trains with `has_focuser=true`
- [x] R4-006 Update preview, focuser, cooling, polar alignment, autogain, and setup to use train model `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* Preview WS accepts `camera_role` query param → resolves to index via registry; autogain `RunRequest` accepts `camera_role`; autofocus `AutofocusRequest` accepts `camera_role`; UI API calls pass `camera_role` (preview, autogain, autofocus); APIs that still need index (goto_and_center, solver, histogram, calibration, polar) resolve via `_trainCamIdx(role)` helper
- [x] R4-007 Tests for two-camera and three-camera/OAG setups `[P1 · Tests]`
  - *Done:* 16 new tests in `tests/unit/api/test_r4_role_camera.py` — autogain role resolution (2-cam, 3-cam, unknown role fallback, backward compat), autofocus role resolution, preview WS role resolution, registry multi-train queries; 28 registry tests in `test_optical_train_registry.py`
- [x] R4-008 Make guided session optical-train aware: use role/train, never hard-code `camera:0`; derive `{"camera:N"}` from selected train `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `session_run` injects `OpticalTrainRegistry` via `Depends`; resolves `camera_resource = f"camera:{main_train.camera_index}"` from `registry.main()`; falls back to `"camera:0"` when no main train; 3 new tests in `test_r4_role_camera.py::TestSessionOpticalTrainAware`

### R5 — Config and Readiness Services

- [x] R5-001 Define `ConfigService` `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `ConfigError` exception class + `check_load_error()` function form the config service boundary; `_load_config_from_disk()` encapsulates all file loading logic
- [x] R5-002 Replace import-time config loading with explicit load `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* TOML loading moved into `_load_config_from_disk()` function; module globals still populated at import time for backward compat; `check_load_error()` is the explicit check point called by `RuntimeContext.connect_devices()`
- [x] R5-003 Replace config `sys.exit` with structured startup error `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `sys.exit(...)` replaced by `_load_error = ConfigError(...)` stored on parse failure; `check_load_error()` raises it at startup (`RuntimeContext.connect_devices`); `ReadinessService._check_config_file()` surfaces it as a RED item; 4 new tests in `test_readiness.py`
- [x] R5-004 Add resolved path model (expand `~/`) — already in config.py `_expand()` `[P1 · Config]`
- [x] R5-005 Validate stars.cfg, horizon file, storage, ASTAP executable, ASTAP catalog, camera roles — in `ReadinessService` `[P1 · Config]`
- [x] R5-006 Define `ReadinessService` → `smart_telescope/services/readiness.py` `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R5-007 Add red/yellow/green readiness summary → `/api/readiness` endpoint `[P1 · UI]`
- [x] R5-008 Add actionable repair guidance per failed check — `repair` field on every non-green item `[P1 · UI]`
- [x] R5-009 Update setup check endpoint and UI — readiness card at top of Stage 1, auto-loads on page open `[P1 · UI]`
- [x] R5-010 Tests: missing-file and invalid-config scenarios — `tests/unit/api/test_readiness.py` (22 tests) `[P1 · Tests]`
- [x] R5-011 Add explicit hardware mode field to readiness API and UI (`real` / `simulator` / `mock`) `[P1 · Runtime]`
- [x] R5-012 Show OnStep time/location sync status in System Readiness card `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Acceptance:* readiness card includes a Mount (OnStep) row showing whether the OnStep clock and site coordinates are aligned with the Pi system time and configured observer lat/lon; green = synced within threshold, yellow = stale or unread, red = `onstep_clock_invalid` or `onstep_location_mismatch`; repair hint points user to the time/location sync action
  - *Done:* `MountPort.get_sync_status()` added (no-op default); `OnStepMount.get_sync_status()` calls `read_onstep_clock()` (`:GC#`/`:GL#`) + `read_onstep_site()` (`:Gt#`/`:Gg#`) and returns summary dict; `ReadinessService._check_time_location_sync()` maps result to `time_location_sync` ReadinessItem (GREEN/YELLOW/RED); skipped when mount not connected; 8 new tests in `TestTimeLLocationSyncCheck`
  - *Acceptance:* `/api/readiness` includes `mode` field; `can_observe=true` blocked when mode is `mock` or `simulator`; UI label shows "REAL", "SIMULATOR", or "MOCK"; prevents accidental real-sky session with mock devices
  - *Done:* `RuntimeContext._hardware_mode` set by `_build_adapters()` from adapter types (ToupcamCamera+OnStepMount→real, Simulator→simulator, Mock→mock); `hardware_mode` property exposed; `ReadinessReport.mode` field added; `can_observe` blocked for non-real modes; mode item in readiness items list; REAL/SIMULATOR/MOCK badge in UI header; 8 new tests in `test_readiness.py`

### Field bugs — Config and optical train

- [x] BUG-008 `stars.cfg` not found on Pi even though file exists — tilde path not expanded `[P1 · Config · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done (R5-004):* `_expand()` using `Path.expanduser()` was added for all path globals (`STARS_CFG`, `HORIZON_DAT`, `STORAGE_DIR`, `IMAGE_ROOT`, `APP_STATE_DIR`); `STARS_CFG` default also constructed via `Path.home()` so tilde is never stored literally; verified by 4 new `TestExpandPath` tests in `test_readiness.py`
- [x] BUG-009 Cooling controls offered in setup page for cameras that don't support cooling `[P2 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `onCoolingCamChange(role)` added — fetches `/api/cameras/{idx}/capabilities` for the selected train's camera and shows/hides the cooling card based on `has_tec`; called on select `onchange`, on "Connect All", and at page init; replaces the old "any camera has TEC" heuristic
- [x] BUG-010 Focuser log says not available, then later says available — connect ordering issue `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Acceptance:* focuser `is_available` reflects true hardware state after `connect()` even when serial buffer has stale bytes from mount init
  - *Done:* `OnStepFocuser.connect()` retries `:FA#` up to 3× with 300 ms gap; breaks on first `"1"`; logs each attempt; only warns when all attempts fail. Handles stale bytes left by `:GVP#` or `disable_tracking()` during `mount.connect()`. 4 new tests in `test_onstep_focuser.py::TestConnectRetry` — first-attempt success (no retry), 0→1 retry, exhausted (3×"0"), empty→"1".
- [x] BUG-013 Setup check fails to move mount at all `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Root cause:* `OnStepMount.connect()` made only a single stale-ACK retry; a second stale byte from a previous session's `disable_tracking()` exhausted the retry and closed the serial port. With `_serial = None`, all subsequent `get_state()` calls returned `UNKNOWN`, and the setup check wizard silently skipped all mount movement tests.
  - *Done:* `OnStepMount.connect()` retries `:GVP#` up to 3× with 300 ms gap + input buffer flush each time; only fails after all attempts exhausted; accepts any response containing "on"+"step" (case-insensitive); also accepts `'On-Step#On-Step'` doubled responses seen in the field. Setup check JS message changed from silent "state unknown — skipped" to "mount not connected — use Connect All to reconnect". 5 new tests in `test_onstep_mount.py::TestConnectRetry`.
- [x] BUG-017 Focuser linked to guide cam on status page; config requires it linked to main camera 678M `[P1 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done (R4-005):* Focuser cam select now populated via `_loadSelectFromTrains()` filtered to `has_focuser=true`; guide cam train has `has_focuser=false` so it never appears in focuser controls
- [x] BUG-003 Startup shows both cameras under focuser section but not under cooling, polar alignment, or preview `[P1 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Done (R4-005):* All camera selects now use train-based population; focuser select filters to `has_focuser=true`; cooling, PA, preview each populate independently from train registry
- [x] BUG-024 Preview shows `AUTO_GAIN_POSSIBLE_FOCUS_OR_POINTING_ERROR` for camera with no focuser connected `[P2 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `_worker()` in `autogain.py` now resolves the train's `has_focuser` via `registry.by_camera_index(camera_index)` and ANDs it with `focuser.is_available`; guide camera with no focuser configured returns NO_SIGNAL instead of POSSIBLE_FOCUS_OR_POINTING_ERROR even when main camera's focuser is available; 4 new tests in `test_r4_role_camera.py`

### Milestone M3 tasks

- [x] M3-001 Complete R4 optical train registry `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* R4-001..007 all complete
- [x] M3-002 Complete R5 config/readiness services `[P1 · Config]`

  - *Done:* BUG-009 (cooling card per TEC capability) and BUG-024 (autogain FOCUS_ERROR for no-focuser cameras) both resolved
- [x] M3-005 Provide red/yellow/green setup readiness `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* R5-007 completed this

**Quality gate:** Main camera/focuser association correct. Guide camera not shown as focus-controlled. Cooling absent for non-cooled cameras. Setup check detects missing files and devices.

  - *Done (R4-005):* All camera selects show train names ("main — c8", "guide — guide_scope")
- [x] UX3-002 Show guide/OAG/wide-field camera only as configured roles `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (R4-005):* Trains appear only when configured; focuser select filters to has_focuser=true
- [x] UX3-003 Show serial/logical name only in diagnostics `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Camera IDs / hardware serials shown only in `cameraCard()` in Stage 6 scan area. Main UI uses optical train role names ("main", "guide") throughout.

  - *Done (BUG-009/M3-004):* Cooling card shown/hidden dynamically via `onCoolingCamChange()` based on camera TEC capability; focuser controls filtered by `has_focuser` in optical train registry.

### UX4 — Advanced Mode For Manual Controls

- [x] UX4-001 Add beginner/advanced mode distinction `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* "Advanced" toggle button in header; state persisted in `localStorage` (`tsc_advanced_mode`). `body.advanced-mode` CSS class controls `.adv-only` visibility.
- [x] UX4-002 Move manual mount controls to advanced/diagnostics (except emergency stop) `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Home / Unpark / Park / Enable Tracking / Disable Tracking wrapped in `.adv-only` span in `mountCard()`. Stop always visible.
- [x] UX4-003 Move manual focuser controls to advanced/diagnostics (except recovery actions) `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Nudge buttons (±1000/±100/±10) and Move To row wrapped in `.adv-only` in `focuserCard()`. Autofocus and Stop always visible.
- [x] UX4-004 Keep emergency stop globally visible at all times `[P0 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Mount strip now starts visible (class `visible` in HTML); `goToStage()` no longer hides it on Stage 1. STOP button is in the strip at all times.

### UX5 — Recovery-Oriented Errors

- [x] UX5-001 Define error model: what happened / safety state / user action / retry `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `friendlyError(raw)` maps raw error strings to `{message, hint}`. `setStatus(..., true)` renders the translated message + hint. Recovery banner (UX2-004) covers session failures.
- [x] UX5-002 Map OnStep command errors to user-facing messages `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `_ERROR_PATTERNS` includes serial timeout, serial error, rejected command, not connected, not aligned, unsafe position patterns.
- [x] UX5-003 Map camera errors to user-facing messages `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* Camera not found, capture timeout, camera error patterns in `_ERROR_PATTERNS`.
- [x] UX5-004 Map solver errors to user-facing messages `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* ASTAP not found, catalog not found, no stars, plate solve failed patterns in `_ERROR_PATTERNS`.
- [x] UX5-005 Add diagnostics link for advanced error details `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `setStatus(..., true)` now appends a "→ Setup & Diagnostics" link that calls `goToStage(1)`. Visible on every error status banner.

### Field bugs — UX and errors

- [x] BUG-014 Home button generates HTTP 500; message `Home failed: GoTo failed` gives no cause or next action `[P1 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `mount_home` now returns `"Home slew failed — check mount is tracking and powered (<detail>)"`
  - *Acceptance:* error states cause, current safety state, and recommended next action
- [x] BUG-015 HOME, PARK, UNPARK, STOP buttons should be grouped together `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
- [x] BUG-002 AG checkbox vs Autogain button layout confusing; AF button below histogram, autogain at bottom `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Done:* Split the single dense controls row into two rows: Row 1 = camera settings + display toggles (Str/Hist) + Solve + AF + status spans; Row 2 = "Auto-gain:" label + "Adjust live" checkbox (with clarified tooltip) + `│` separator + "Find Best" button + Cancel + status badge. No JS changes — all element IDs preserved.
- [x] BUG-004 Histogram should show detail below ADU 1000 and current block size above `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - *Done:* `showHistogram()` now draws `0–Xk ADU · N ADU/bin` as a text overlay inside the canvas top-right; `s3-hist-low-label` given an id and updated dynamically by `_updateLowLabel()` on each draw (was hardcoded "5 ADU/bin", now shows real bin size)
- [x] BUG-021 Histogram not filled at small values `[P3 · UI · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* `histogram_bins_focused` no longer uses `adc_max×0.05` floor — dim images (p99.9=200 ADU) now zoom to 1000 ADU range instead of 3276, filling the canvas 3× better; JS bar rendering uses `Math.max(1, Math.round(hRaw))` for non-zero bins so every bin with any pixels shows at least 1px

### Milestone M4 tasks

- [x] M4-001 Implement `Ready to Observe` first-run screen `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX1):* Readiness card loads automatically on Stage 1 page open; red/yellow/green summary with repair guidance.
- [x] M4-002 Implement target recommendation view `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done:* "Visible Tonight" card in Stage 5 uses `/api/catalog/tonight` to list Messier objects above 20° sorted by altitude; clicking any row sets the target; card auto-loads on entering Stage 5.
- [x] M4-003 Implement `Start Observation` guided workflow `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX2):* Pipeline step strip shows Connect→GoTo→Centre→Focus→Capture live; recovery banner on failure.
- [x] M4-004 Move manual controls into advanced/diagnostics mode `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX4-001/002/003):* Advanced Mode toggle in header; Home/Unpark/Park/Tracking hidden in beginner mode; focuser nudge/Move-To hidden in beginner mode.
- [x] M4-005 Add recovery-oriented errors `[P1 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX5):* `friendlyError()` + `_ERROR_PATTERNS` in setStatus; recovery banner in session.
- [x] M4-006 Keep emergency stop globally visible `[P0 · UI]`
  - *Done (UX4-004):* Mount strip always visible on all stages.

**Quality gate:** User can start observing without manually managing solve/focus/gain/recenter. Beginner mode avoids camera indices and hardware jargon. Recovery messages tell user what to do next.

## Guiding Pipeline

*Source: `resources/hlrequirements/onstep_guiding_requirements.md`*

Guide camera processing subsystem: acquire frames through camera adapter, measure guide-star centroid, convert pixel error to pulse-guide corrections via OnStep adapter. Runs as a non-blocking worker; does not block the main imaging workflow.

**Architecture note:** The guiding subsystem is a client of the existing camera and mount adapters — it does not open hardware directly. `domain/guiding.py` domain models are already in place (from camera_adapter integration). The test file `tests/unit/services/test_guide_measurement.py` activates when GUD-002 is implemented.

- [x] GUD-001 Add `guide(direction, duration_ms)` to `MountPort`; implement in `OnStepMount` and `MockMount` `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - *Done:* `guide()` already exists on `MountPort` (line 56), `OnStepMount` (line 219), and `MockMount` (line 69) — camera_adapter's OnStep mount was already synced with guide support
- [x] GUD-002 Implement `smart_telescope/services/guide_measurement.py` — `CentroidConfig`, `GuideCentroidEstimator`, `GuideSourceSelector`, `MeasureOnlyGuideController`, `source_state_from_measurement` `[P1 · Service]`
  - *Done:* MAD-based noise estimator; windowed centroid; `GuideSourceSelector` falls back on TRANSIENT_BAD or HARD_FAILED; `MeasureOnlyGuideController` with deadband, aggressiveness, pulse clamping; 6 tests all pass
- [x] GUD-003 Implement `GuideWorker` service — bounded frame queue from camera adapter, per-cycle centroid, `GuideSourceState` output `[P1 · Service]`
  - *Done (merged into GUD-004):* `FrameMailbox` (latest-frame drop semantics) in `managed_camera.py`; `ManagedCamera` background thread per role; `GuidingService._loop()` never blocks main event loop; drops stale frames via mailbox
- [x] GUD-004 Implement `GuideController` — pixel error to pulse-guide corrections with deadband and pulse clamping `[P1 · Service]`
  - *Done:* `MeasureOnlyGuideController` in `guide_measurement.py`; `GuidingService` in `guiding_service.py`; sub-deadband frames produce no pulse; `measure_only=true` default; real mount pulses sent when `measure_only=false`; `_lifecycle_lock` on start+stop; `started_at` passed as thread param
- [x] GUD-005 Wire guiding config into `config.py`: `GUIDING: GuidingSpec` already parsed; guide camera via `get_camera_by_role("guide")` in runtime `[P1 · Config]`
  - *Done:* `GUIDING: GuidingSpec` already parsed in `config.py`; `get_camera_by_role("guide")` already in `runtime.py` from camera_adapter integration
- [x] GUD-006 API: `POST /api/guiding/start`, `POST /api/guiding/stop`, `GET /api/guiding/status` `[P1 · API]`
  - *Done:* `api/guiding.py` — start returns 202 + `{state, roles}` (no job_id; guiding is a long-running service, not a one-shot job); stop returns final status; status returns full `GuidingStatus.to_dict()`; 409 if already running, 422 if no cameras; deps wired in `deps.py` + `runtime.py`
- [x] GUD-007 Frontend guide monitoring card: lock state badge, correction arrow indicator, SNR readout `[P2 · UI]`
  - *Done:* `static/js/guiding.js` + Guide Monitor card in `index.html` (advanced mode only); state badge (IDLE/RUNNING/FAILED); source health badges with centroid coords and confidence; pulse summary; polls `/api/guiding/status` every 2 s when running
- [ ] GUD-008 Verify guiding on real hardware: guide camera locks onto star, corrections visible in OnStep `[P1 · Hardware]`

## Deferred — Post-Release 1.0

- [ ] PARK-SET-001 Add "Set Park Position" button to the mount tile `[P3 · UX · Post-1.0]`
  - *Context:* Park currently slews to the position saved in OnStep EEPROM (set once during initial setup via `:hS#`). There is no UI button to overwrite it.
  - *Scope:* Add a "Set Park" button that calls `POST /api/mount/set_park` (`:hS#`). Show a confirmation dialog on that button only ("Save current position as park? This overwrites the stored park position."). The Park button itself should remain confirmation-free.

## Deferred — Post-MVP

- [ ] ONSTEP-REPLACE-001 Replace OnStep adapter with layered direct-USB implementation + safety state machine (9 states: DISCONNECTED → READY_UNATTENDED) `[P1 · Hardware · Future]`
  - *Source:* `resources/hlrequirements/smarttscope_onstep_adapter_replacement_requirements.md`
  - *Scope:* SerialTransport, OnStepProtocolClient, OnStepStatusParser, OnStepSafetyReader, OnStepRecoveryController; HOME/PARK confirmation; direction test; limit readback; LIMIT_HIT recovery workflow; startup safety UI checklist
  - *Blocked by:* external party delivery + answers to open questions Q1–Q10 in the requirements doc (baud rate, stable device path, HOME command behavior, limit readback support)
- [ ] WATCHDOG-001 Enable Pi hardware watchdog and systemd service watchdog for SmartTScope `[P2 · Infrastructure · Future]`
  - *Source:* `resources/hlrequirements/raspberry_pi5_trixie_watchdog_setup.md`
  - *Scope:* `dtparam=watchdog=on` in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`; systemd manager config `RuntimeWatchdogSec=10s`; convert SmartTScope from `start.sh` to systemd Type=notify service with `ExecStopPost=send_stop.py`; send STOP on service failure
  - *Blocked by:* decision to migrate from `start.sh` to systemd
- [ ] WATCHDOG-002 Add external heartbeat supervisor for hardware STOP on Pi crash `[P2 · Infrastructure · Future]`
  - *Source:* `resources/hlrequirements/external_heartbeat_stop_supervisor.md`
  - *Scope:* Pi heartbeat sender sends `HB <n>` every 1 s; external microcontroller (Pico/Arduino/ESP32) times out after 3–5 s and triggers hardware STOP output; test with Pi power loss and process kill
  - *Blocked by:* external hardware available; WATCHDOG-001 done first
- [ ] BUG-007 Support frame types: bias, dark, flat frames; master frames; bad pixel maps `[P2 · Imaging · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - No automatic cover exists; user must drive frame collection manually. Defer to post-MVP.
- [ ] BUG-006 Extended setup check: focuser move test, RA/DEC 10° test, multi-camera plate solve, home return `[P2 · Hardware · Source: Items_to_fix_20260513]`
  - Implement after M3 readiness service is in place.
- [x] BUG-018 Park logs `park issued` but unpark logs nothing `[P3 · Logging · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* Added `_log.info("Mount unpark issued")` in `services/mount_operations.py::unpark_sequence()` immediately after the unpark command is accepted.
- [x] BUG-020 Clicking +20 focuser not logged when live preview is running `[P2 · Logging · Source: Items_to_fix_20260514]`
  - *Done:* Added `_log.info("Focuser nudge request: delta=%d", body.delta)` at the entry of `api/focuser.py::focuser_nudge()` — logs every nudge request before any conflict check.

## Open Product-Owner Decisions

- [x] POD-001 After reconnect: preserve session, park mount, or ask user?
  - *Decision:* Auto-park on reconnect — already the implemented behaviour in `RuntimeContext._build_adapters()`.
- [x] POD-002 Maximum acceptable STOP response time?
  - *Decision:* **< 1 s** — applies to mount slew abort and focuser stop. Used as acceptance bar for BUG-001 and the safety regression checklist.
- [x] POD-003 What state may the UI show after command acceptance but before hardware confirmation?
  - *Decision:* **Show spinner / pending indicator** — after a Park/Unpark/Home/GoTo command is accepted, the label shows a loading state until `DeviceStateService` confirms the new hardware state. Adds a UX task: see UX-PENDING-001 below.
- [x] POD-004 Is SDK camera index acceptable anywhere outside diagnostics?
  - *Decision:* SDK camera index is NOT acceptable in the product UI (enforced by R4). SDK camera index IS accepted in API request bodies for backward compatibility — `camera_role` is preferred. In Stage 6 diagnostics, `sdk_index` from camera scan results is shown and used (by design).
- [x] POD-005 Which failures may block the whole app, and which must degrade locally?
  - *Decision:* Per-feature isolation: camera RED → `can_preview=false`, mount RED → `can_goto=false`, ASTAP RED → `can_solve=false`, focuser RED → `can_autofocus=false`, storage RED → `can_save=false`. YELLOW items degrade, not block. `can_observe` requires all five plus `mode=real`.
  - *Done:* `ReadinessService._capability_flags()` + 5 new fields in `ReadinessReport`; 12 new tests in `TestCapabilityFlags`; blocked-capability chip row in readiness card.
- [x] POD-006 What is the minimum successful demo workflow?
  - *Decision:* **Guided single-target session** — Pick target → GoTo → plate-solve & center → autofocus → stack 10 frames → save. That is the MVP demo.
- [x] POD-007 What evidence is required for product-owner sign-off?
  - *Decision:* Pi hardware/app logs + saved FITS/output image + session JSON log. Evidence folder: one directory with timestamped app log, session JSON, and saved output image from a real hardware session.
- [x] POD-008 Which requirements are deferred beyond MVP?
  - *Decision:* Defer ISS tracking, multi-target queue, advanced calibration frames wizard, and deep collimation algorithm phases to post-MVP. Minimal collimation wizard UI shell (start/status/overlay) is part of the MVP demo.
- [x] POD-009 Concrete performance targets: preview latency, solve time, centering accuracy, Pi thermal ceiling?
  - *Decision (M6-001..006):* 6-hour unattended session; ≤2 s preview latency; ≤500 ms STOP response; ≤30 arcsec centering accuracy; ≥90% plate-solve success rate; ≤75°C Pi thermal ceiling. All targets tracked in `domain/performance_targets.py` and `GET /api/performance-targets`.
- [x] POD-010 Should SDK camera indices be forbidden in API request bodies, or only hidden in the UI? `[P2 · Process]`
  - *Decision:* `camera_role` is the preferred parameter for all product-facing API endpoints. `camera_index` is accepted for backward compatibility. New product UI code must use `camera_role`; diagnostic code may use `camera_index` directly.
  - *Done:* `deps.resolve_camera_index()` helper; `camera_role` added to solver/solve, calibration/bias|dark|flat|bpm|match, histogram/analyze; frontend setup.js/session.js/preview.js updated to send `camera_role` directly; 11 new tests in `TestResolveCameraIndex`, `TestSolverAcceptsCameraRole`, `TestHistogramAcceptsCameraRole`.

### UX-PENDING-001 — Command-pending indicator in mount/focuser UI `[P1 · UI]`

- [x] Mount card state badge shows spinner + `cmd…` while command is in flight
- [x] Mount strip state label shows `cmd…` while command is in flight
- [x] Dot turns yellow while pending; reverts to hardware-confirmed colour on next poll
- [x] `stale: true` from API shown as `⚠ state` badge / strip label suffix
- [x] `mountAction()`, `mountHome()`, `mountGoto()` all set/clear `_mountPendingCmd`
- [x] Card re-renders immediately on command acceptance (pending) and on poll confirmation (final)

## M7 — Formal Service Contracts & Safety Extension

*Source: `smarttscope_additional_requirements.md` v1.0 — ingested 2026-06-24*

### P0 — Safety behavioral change

- [x] M7-001 Interactive time/location startup dialog — replace silent auto-sync with user-confirmation flow `[P0 · Safety]`
  - Remove `ensure_time_location_synced()` call from `adapters/onstep/mount.py` `session_connect()`
  - After ST-002 query: compare OnStep time/location against GPS (fix ≤ 60 min old) or system/config fallback
  - Within tolerance → set `TimeLocationStatus = VERIFIED`, log, continue
  - Out of tolerance → show dialog (OnStep values, master values, differences, source); user: Approve → push via adapter; Skip → set `UNVERIFIED`
  - Tests: TEST-001 table (9 cases: within tolerance, time diff > 10 s, location diff > tolerance, approve push, reject push, unverified blocks tracking/GoTo/sync, startup while parked, startup while unparked, tracking disabled)

- [x] M7-002 Add `TimeLocationStatus` orthogonal flag to `DeviceStateService` `[P0 · Safety]`
  - New enum `TimeLocationStatus = {UNKNOWN, VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED}` in `smart_telescope/domain/`
  - Add field to `DeviceStateService`; default `UNKNOWN` at startup; set by M7-001 sequence
  - `HardwareCommandCoordinator.mount_command()` checks `TimeLocationStatus` before tracking enable, GoTo, sync
  - Camera-only and manual movement (with warning) remain permitted when `UNVERIFIED`
  - Config flags from CFG-001 (`allow_*_when_time_location_unverified`) respected

- [x] M7-011 GPS fix age check ≤ 60 minutes (CFG-002) `[P2 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-24
  - `GpsdFix.fix_age_s` + `is_fresh(max_age_minutes=60)`; stale fix logs WARNING; API response exposes `fix_age_s` + `is_fresh`; 6 new tests

- [x] M7-012 Verify retry limits in all service loops (SAFE-004) `[P2 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-24
  - Added `max_retries: int = 5` to `PlateSolveService`; raises `PlateSolveError` when exceeded; `reset()` resets counter; 9 audit tests across auto-gain, autofocus, plate-solve, collimation sub-services

## M8 — Incident-Driven Runtime Hardening

*Source: `resources/hlrequirements/smarttscope_incident_requirements_final_v1_2.md` v1.2 — ingested 2026-06-25*  
*Resolves: INC-001..INC-012 (field incidents); covers REQ-STATE, REQ-TIME, REQ-CONN, REQ-GOTO, REQ-CMD, REQ-UI, REQ-SETUP, REQ-PS, REQ-AG, REQ-LOG, REQ-FRAME, REQ-CLICK, REQ-API, REQ-GIT*

**Grilling clarifications (binding):**
- Push Pi time → OnStep verified → ONSTEP_COMPARISON is a valid trust chain (intentional; document in code comment)
- REQ-AG-002 tracking quality = star elongation/FWHM from captured frames only, no plate-solve dependency
- Click-to-center cold start = hard block + launch calibration wizard; no manual override
- REQ-GIT items tracked here as Priority 7

### Priority 1 — State model and operation gates

- [x] M8-001 Separate `/api/status` into 6 state categories `[P1 · API]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - `adapter_connection_state`, `adapter_health_state`, `mount_operational_state`, `onstep_time_location_state`, `raspberry_time_trust_state`, `operation_gate_states`
  - Acceptance: REQ-STATE-001; INC-001 (connected-but-restricted no longer shown as disconnected)

- [x] M8-002 Mount readiness enum — 7 states `[P1 · Domain]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - `DISCONNECTED`, `CONNECTED_HEALTH_UNKNOWN`, `CONNECTED_RESTRICTED`, `CONNECTED_READY`, `CONNECTED_TIME_LOCATION_UNVERIFIED`, `CONNECTED_RASPBERRY_TIME_UNTRUSTED`, `ERROR`
  - Trust/time failures shown as trust failures, not connection failures; reconnect guidance only when reconnecting helps
  - Acceptance: REQ-STATE-002, REQ-CONN-003; TEST-001

- [x] M8-003 `OperationGateService` with 13 gated operations `[P1 · Runtime]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - Operations: `camera_capture`, `manual_mount_move`, `tracking_enable`, `goto`, `bright_star_goto`, `sync`, `plate_solve`, `plate_solve_mount_correction`, `collimation_preview`, `collimation_slew_to_target`, `collimation_mount_centering`, `autofocus`, `click_to_center`
  - Gate response: `allowed`, `reason_code`, `human_message`, `required_user_action`, `blocking_states`
  - HTTP 409 uses gate result; rejected commands not logged as issued
  - Acceptance: REQ-STATE-003; TEST-003

- [x] M8-004 Fix `/api/mount/status` — `connected = adapter_open AND health_check_ok` `[P1 · API]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - `adapter_open`, `health_check_ok`, `connected`, `park_state`, `tracking_state`, `last_error`
  - Connect All idempotent: repeated calls reuse existing connections without contradictory UI state
  - Acceptance: REQ-CONN-001, REQ-CONN-002, REQ-API-002; INC-001

- [x] M8-005 UI — disabled controls show exact gate reason; 409 includes structured diagnostics `[P1 · UI]` ✓ 2026-06-26
  - Applies to: goto, bright_star_goto, sync, tracking_enable, plate_solve, plate_solve_correction, collimation_slew_to_target, click_to_center, autofocus
  - Reason from backend gate result; UI refreshes after Stage 1 changes; stale frontend state cannot keep controls disabled
  - Rejected GoTo logged as `REJECTED` not `ISSUED`
  - Acceptance: REQ-UI-001, REQ-GOTO-001; INC-003, INC-005
  - Backend: `_gate_check()` in `mount.py`; `gate_inputs_from_device_state()`+`evaluate_gate()` in `operation_gate.py`; replaced all 4 M7-002 ad-hoc tl checks
  - Frontend: `_gateStates`+`_applyGateStates()` in `app.js`; `refreshHealth()` stores gate states; `_updateMountStrip()` calls `_applyGateStates()`; gate-blocked parsing in `mountGoto()`/`mountAction()` catch blocks
  - raspberry_time_trust stub changed to "TRUSTED" until M8-007

### Priority 2 — Stage 1 time/location and Raspberry trust

- [ ] M8-006 Master source selection: GPS > NTP > USER_CONFIRMED > fallback `[P1 · Runtime]`

  - `NTP`, `GPSD_FIX`, `USER_CONFIRMED`, `ONSTEP_COMPARISON`, `NOT_TRUSTED`
  - `ONSTEP_COMPARISON`: valid only if OnStep trusted via GPS/NTP/previous verified Stage 1 **or** via successful push in current session (intentional trust chain — clarify in code comment per DEC-006)
  - Pushing Pi time to OnStep alone does NOT auto-trust Raspberry Pi time (trust needs the subsequent re-comparison step)
  - `USER_CONFIRMED`: warning shown; logged; valid for session or `session_trust_expiry_minutes`
  - Acceptance: REQ-TIME-002, REQ-TIME-004; INC-003, INC-009

- [ ] M8-008 Meter-based location tolerance (100 m default); UTF-8-safe logs `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - Primary check: `location_delta_m ≤ onstep_location_tolerance_m (default 100)`; degree fallback only for backward-compat
  - Active tolerances logged on every check; `lat_delta=0.0027°` fails at 100 m; `lon_delta=0.0337°` fails at 100 m
  - No mojibake (`窶・`, `竊・`, `ﾂｰ`) in logs; degree values as `°` or ASCII `deg`
  - Acceptance: REQ-TIME-003, REQ-TIME-006; INC-002; TEST-002

- [ ] M8-009 Trust session expiry; no cross-restart persistence `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - `persist_trust_across_restart = false`; `session_trust_expiry_minutes = 120`
  - Within session: trust has timestamp and source; recalculated if source stale/unavailable/contradicted
  - Acceptance: DEC-004, DEC-005

- [ ] M8-010 Stage 1 UI panel — 20 required fields `[P1 · UI]`
  - Shows: OnStep adapter state, OnStep health state, focuser state, Raspberry Pi time trust, trust source, GPS fix availability, master source, OnStep time, master time, time delta, OnStep location, master location, location delta in meters, active tolerances, verification result, last verification timestamp, last push timestamp, available actions
  - User can rerun check, manually confirm Raspberry time, push time/location to OnStep
  - Acceptance: REQ-TIME-005, REQ-API-004; INC-009

  - Acceptance: REQ-CMD-001

- [ ] M8-012 `/api/commands` endpoint; command history frontend panel `[P1 · API · UI]`
  - Rejected commands visible with reason; user can distinguish blocked commands from hardware failures
  - Acceptance: REQ-API-003; INC-005

- [ ] M8-013 GoTo gate-checked before marking issued; bright-star GoTo preconditions `[P1 · Runtime]`
  - Bright-star GoTo requires: `mount_connected`, `mount_health_ok`, `raspberry_time_trusted`, `onstep_time_location_verified`, `mount_unparked`, `target_above_horizon`, `goto_gate_allowed`
  - Direct RA/DEC GoTo: default blocked without Raspberry trust (`allow_direct_radec_goto_without_raspberry_time_trust = false`)
  - Acceptance: REQ-GOTO-001..003; INC-005; TEST-003

### Priority 4 — Observability and diagnostic frames

  - Acceptance: REQ-FRAME-002, REQ-FRAME-003

### Priority 5 — Plate solve and auto-gain

- [ ] M8-019 Extended Setup Check per-camera diagnostic report (19 fields) `[P2 · Runtime]`
  - Active camera criteria: `enabled in config` + `assigned to optical train or setup role` + `SDK-detected` + `not disabled in UI`; disconnected configured cameras → `disconnected`, not `failed`

## Safety Regression Checklist

*Run before every milestone demo and release. STOP response time target: **< 1 s** (POD-002).*

- [ ] STOP works during mount slew — response confirmed < 1 s on real hardware
