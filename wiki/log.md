## 2026-04-22 — Documentation update: Pi installer, reviewer corrections, Sprint 0 close

**What changed**:
- `README.md` — added Raspberry Pi 5 one-command install section; updated project structure to include `scripts/` and `hardware.yml`; clarified hardware tests live in `hardware.yml` (manual trigger only)
- `docs/agile-plan.md` — updated all Python version references from 3.11 → 3.13; removed deprecated `ANN101`/`ANN102` ruff ignore rules; corrected S0-6 (`asyncio.Event` → `threading.Event`); added `pytest-mock>=3.15` to example `pyproject.toml`; marked Sprint 0 stories S0-1 through S0-6, S0-8, S0-9 as done; updated Sprint 0 DoD checkboxes; noted S0-7 deferred to Sprint 1
- `wiki/vertical-slice-mvp.md` — corrected C8 native pixel scale from `~0.20 arcsec/px` to `0.38 arcsec/px` to match `C8_NATIVE` profile in `runner.py`
- `scripts/install_pi.sh` — new: automated installer for Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Bookworm); covers system packages, Python 3.13 via deadsnakes PPA, venv, `pip install -e .[dev]`, optional ASTAP ARM64, verification test run

**Source**: reviewer audit (2026-04-22), `runner.py:49` for pixel scale ground truth

## 2026-04-21 — Sprint 0 executed: dev pipeline + TDD foundation

**What changed**:
- `pyproject.toml` — Python version pin relaxed to >=3.10; ruff target-version py310; mypy python_version 3.10; ANN excluded from test files
- `smart_telescope/ports/focuser.py` — new `FocuserPort` ABC (connect, disconnect, move, get_position)
- `smart_telescope/ports/mount.py` — added `stop()` abstract method
- `smart_telescope/adapters/mock/focuser.py` — new `MockFocuser` (fail_connect, move, position)
- `smart_telescope/adapters/mock/mount.py` — implemented `stop()`
- `smart_telescope/workflow/runner.py` — added: structured logging (INFO per state transition), focuser wired into connect stage and cleanup, `stop()` + `threading.Event` cancellation, `_wait_for_slew` checks stop event, `run()` clears event on entry
- `tests/unit/workflow/test_logging.py` — 6 logging tests (TDD: RED → GREEN)
- `tests/unit/workflow/test_focuser.py` — 12 focuser tests (TDD: RED → GREEN)
- `tests/unit/workflow/test_cancellation.py` — 6 cancellation tests (TDD: RED → GREEN)
- `tests/unit/adapters/test_replay_camera.py` — 8 ReplayCamera unit tests
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions: lint → typecheck → test + coverage gate on push/PR
- All source files ruff-clean and mypy-strict-clean

**Result**: 133 tests passing, 15 skipped (hardware), 98% coverage. Ruff clean. Mypy clean. CI configured.

## 2026-04-19 — Hardware update: camera changed to ToupTek

**Pages updated**:
- `hardware-platform.md` — added ToupTek camera section; updated summary
- `vertical-slice-mvp.md` — replaced ZWO ASI SDK references with ToupTek SDK
- `README.md` — updated hardware table

## 2026-04-19 — Walking skeleton implementation

**Source**: vertical-slice-mvp.md (spec), implementation

**What was built**:
- `smart_telescope/domain/` — `SessionState` enum, 8 typed result dataclasses, `SessionLog` with full `to_dict()` schema
- `smart_telescope/ports/` — abstract interfaces for camera, mount, solver, stacker, storage
- `smart_telescope/workflow/runner.py` — `VerticalSliceRunner`: linear 8-stage pipeline, `WorkflowError`, state machine with `on_state_change` callback
- `smart_telescope/adapters/mock/` — 5 mock adapters with configurable failure modes
- `tests/integration/test_vertical_slice.py` — 28 tests: happy path (11), plate-solve failure (4), recenter exceeded (4), stack failure (2), save failure (3), mount failures (4)

**Result**: 28/28 tests passing. One full `IDLE → SAVED` run executes in <1ms.

## 2026-04-19 — Vertical slice definition

**Source**: requirements.md, hardware-platform.md (internal synthesis)

**Pages created**:
- `vertical-slice-mvp.md` — full stage-by-stage spec for the MVP core slice: 8 stages, explicit state machine, acceptance criteria per stage, component map, and out-of-scope boundaries

**Pages updated**:
- `index.md` — added vertical-slice-mvp entry

## 2026-04-19 — Ingest: requirements review

**Source**: requirements-review (external analysis, 2026-04-19)

**Pages updated**:
